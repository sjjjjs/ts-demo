1
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:44,757
Let's break it down.

2
00:00:46,808 --> 00:00:49,232
Hydrogen.
What does that give us?

3
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:52,012
By mole?
We're looking at 63%.

4
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,450
63?

5
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:55,955
That is a big bite.

6
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,646
My next step's
gotta be oxygen.

7
00:00:57,654 --> 00:00:59,161
Oxygen: 26%.

8
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:01,759
26.
There you have your water.

9
00:01:01,886 --> 00:01:02,999
Carbon: 9%.

10
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,895
Carbon: 9.

11
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:08,520
- For a total of 98%?
- Right.

12
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:12,611
- Nitrogen: 1.25%.
- 1.25.

13
00:01:12,668 --> 00:01:15,140
That brings it
to 99 and a quarter.

14
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,340
Which only leaves you
with the trace elements

15
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:20,826
down where the magic happens.

16
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:23,936
Oh, wait a minute.
What about calcium?

17
00:01:23,937 --> 00:01:25,503
Calcium's not a trace.

18
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,451
Got a whole skeleton
to account for.

19
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,291
- You would think, right?
- Right.

20
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:33,195
Calcium. Calcium is only .25%.

21
00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:35,760
What?
That low?

22
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,256
Seriously?

23
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:39,970
Damn, I never would
have thought that.

24
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:43,463
Okay, so where
does iron fit in?

25
00:01:43,464 --> 00:01:45,939
Iron. Wow, okay.

26
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:49,940
.00004%.

27
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:53,231
What?

28
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:55,989
You can't have hemoglobin
without iron.

29
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:58,860
- Apparently, it don't take much.
- No, it don't. Go figure.

30
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,910
- Sodium.
- Sodium:.04.

31
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:07,652
Phosphorus:.19.

32
00:02:07,658 --> 00:02:11,323
.19.
There we go.

33
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:15,557
So, the whole thing...

34
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:17,944
adds up to...

35
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:22,095
99.888042%.

36
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:29,307
We are .111958%...

37
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:33,029
shy.

38
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:35,322
Supposedly
that's everything.

39
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:41,409
I don't know.
I just... I just...

40
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:45,041
Just seems like
something's missing, doesn't it?

41
00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:49,355
There got to be more
to a human being than that.

44
00:03:20,941 --> 00:03:22,480
I hate these shoes.

45
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:25,565
These shoes make me look like
I should be changing bedpans,

46
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:28,244
like I should be squeaking
around bringing soup

47
00:03:28,252 --> 00:03:30,351
to some disgusting old person,

48
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:32,534
then take the bus home
to my 16 cats.

49
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,819
Then why are you
wearing them?

50
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:37,269
I like the support.

51
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,820
My arches happen to be
extremely archy.

52
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,016
Yo. What's up?

53
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:46,783
Hey, can you call me,
like, in two minutes?

54
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:48,504
Thanks. Bye.

55
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:51,911
Gotta go take this.

56
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:54,185
Female?

57
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:57,391
Louis.

58
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:01,145
Not like it's any
of your business, though.

59
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,872
Just be quick about it.

60
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:07,699
Oh, and, um,
please don't say yo.

61
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,154
You can't know
how much I hate that.

62
00:04:16,614 --> 00:04:19,853
You missed a... spot right there.

63
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:22,349
Should you be
up on that ladder?

64
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,972
You're more than welcome
to take over for me up here.

65
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,252
I don't see why you don't
just get Walt to do it.

66
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:30,060
Yeah.
There's an idea.

67
00:04:32,748 --> 00:04:35,986
So, I'm working
on this new short story,

68
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:39,826
and there's this stoner character in it,
and I'm trying to...

69
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:43,902
Well, know you,
actually, let me back up.

70
00:04:43,947 --> 00:04:46,541
You've smoked your

71
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,333
fair share of pot
in college, didn't you?

72
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,821
I mean, you at least tried it.

73
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,531
Come on.

74
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:04,257
I perhaps tried it. Why?

75
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:06,857
Do you rember it having
an effect on your mood,

76
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,563
like changing it
in any major way, or...

77
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,250
It made me more serious.

78
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,422
Really?

79
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:16,578
Because I mostly rember

80
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,712
it made me light-headed.
That's about it.

81
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:23,285
I was just wondering
if it maybe could...

82
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:30,325
You know, it's just
a character thing I'm stuck on.

83
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:31,764
Never mind.

84
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:34,207
- Walter Jr.'s on pot?
- What?

85
00:05:34,312 --> 00:05:36,990
No! No.

86
00:05:37,227 --> 00:05:39,655
- What would make you even...
- Where's he getting it from?

87
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,022
- Marie.
- Seriously. Is it this Louis person?

88
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:45,529
What are you going
to do about this?

89
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:48,037
You need
to look me in the eye.

90
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:52,016
I am strictly asking about a story
that I am writing, that's all.

91
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:55,902
Right hand to God,
Walter Jr. is not on pot.

92
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,132
Certainly not
as far as I know.

93
00:06:00,438 --> 00:06:02,249
Not as far as you know?

94
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,795
Marie.

95
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,993
Look at me.

96
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:57,414
Hey, turn around
and look at me.

97
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,806
This...
This here...

98
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:08,853
I wouldn't do this
to my worst enemy.

99
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:12,552
This is degrading.

100
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:18,895
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:24,029
You hope I'll make it easy on you
and just drop dead, don't you?

102
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:26,305
Well, I won't.

103
00:08:26,765 --> 00:08:28,982
So either kill me
or let me go.

104
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:32,867
You don't have it
in you, Walter.

105
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:38,891
How do you know my name?

106
00:08:40,248 --> 00:08:41,186
Jesse.

107
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,076
He told Emilio and me.

108
00:08:45,338 --> 00:08:47,712
When he came by
to sell your meth?

109
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:51,812
So what?
You threaten him, huh?

110
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:54,696
- Did you beat it out of him?
- Not even close.

111
00:08:58,301 --> 00:09:00,198
What else did he tell you?

112
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:04,373
Pretty much everything
you can think of.

113
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:07,046
How you were his
high school teacher.

114
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,209
How one time you taught about carbon
dioxide by making grape soda in class.

115
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:14,668
How you have a son
who's retarded,

116
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,230
or in a wheelchair
or something.

117
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,729
This shouldn't come across
as some news flash.

118
00:09:22,056 --> 00:09:23,996
That partner of yours...

119
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:26,382
he's got a big mouth.

120
00:09:27,454 --> 00:09:31,099
Walter, I don't know what you
think you're doing here,

121
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:35,912
but trust me, this line of work
doesn't suit you.

122
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,392
So I should just
let you go, then?

123
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,170
Just unlock you
and adios, huh?

124
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:49,898
I don't see what
real choice you have

125
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:53,036
if it's between that
and cold-blooded murder.

126
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:54,949
Besides...

127
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:58,926
your real problem
is sitting upstairs.

128
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:19,486
Occupied!

129
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:22,786
Hey, yo, I'm trying
to pinch one off in here!

130
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:25,111
Just give me
some privacy, would ya?

131
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,706
What the hell, man?

132
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:33,515
What are you doing, man?

133
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,223
- You asshole!
- You told him my name.

134
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,470
- Says who? Him?
- My name, where I work.

135
00:10:38,478 --> 00:10:41,063
- You told him about my son!
- Don't touch me!

136
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:42,992
- Damn junkie!
- No, give me that!

137
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:46,071
Too late! This is going down
the toilet. Watch it go!

138
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:48,375
No, that's worth 40 grand,
you stupid shit.

139
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:51,076
It's worth nothing
when you smoke it all.

140
00:10:51,195 --> 00:10:52,815
Get off the toilet.

141
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,793
Get off the toilet!

142
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:58,929
Get off the toilet!

143
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,643
Stop it!

144
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:07,386
No! No way!

145
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,961
What the hell do you
think you're going?

146
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:50,799
- Back off, man! Jesus!
- We've got work to do!

147
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:53,903
No, you got work to do.
I did my part.

148
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:56,948
You mean that obscenity that I spent
the last two hours cleaning up?

149
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:59,769
- That is your contribution?
- Yo! Kiss my pink ass, man!

150
00:11:59,772 --> 00:12:01,543
I didn't ask
for any of this!

151
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:03,702
How am I supposed
to live here now, huh?

152
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:06,513
My whole house smells like
toe cheese and dry cleaning.

153
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:09,237
Because you didn't
follow my instructions!

154
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,374
Oh, well,
heil Hitler, bitch.

155
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:13,611
And let me tell you
something else.

156
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:16,763
We flipped a coin,
okay?

157
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:18,250
You and me.

158
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:19,674
You and me!

159
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:22,125
Coin flip is sacred.

160
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:31,014
Damn it.

161
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,017
Your job is waiting for you
in that basement,

162
00:12:35,027 --> 00:12:37,029
as per the coin.

163
00:12:37,202 --> 00:12:39,011
Fucking do it already.

164
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,326
That's what she said.

165
00:12:56,903 --> 00:13:00,231
Yeah, I think we have some of those.
Yeah, you'll have to try them on.

166
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:02,444
- Hello.
- 7½, maybe. I don't know.

167
00:13:02,493 --> 00:13:05,115
Excuse me.
Do you have these in black?

168
00:13:07,488 --> 00:13:10,636
Anyway, so like I was saying,
I went to the party the other night.

169
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,382
Yeah, Tony was there.

170
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:20,860
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.

171
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:23,468
Sorry, baby. I'm kinda
busy here. What's up?

172
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:28,000
Kind of a lot, actually,
and it's a delicate subject,

173
00:13:28,018 --> 00:13:30,499
so I need you to focus and...

174
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:32,684
Hey, sit down!
Sit down!

175
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:34,534
Damn it, Hank.

176
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,101
Well, sorry, babe.
I'm just...

177
00:13:37,156 --> 00:13:39,618
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

178
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,414
Sit down!
Sit your ass down!

179
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:44,160
Comprende?
You, too! Sit down!

180
00:13:44,252 --> 00:13:45,509
Siéntete!

181
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:51,371
I'm back, baby.
What's up?

182
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,061
Walter Jr.

183
00:13:53,357 --> 00:13:55,063
Yeah,
what about him?

184
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:56,869
Marijuana.

185
00:13:57,143 --> 00:13:58,945
- He's smoking it.
- Bullshit.

186
00:13:58,989 --> 00:14:01,394
Excuse me.
His own mother seems to think so.

187
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:03,638
- Skyler told you that?
- She inferred it.

188
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:05,365
She inferred it, huh?

189
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:09,002
She strongly
inferred it, like...

190
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:13,582
"Doctor, my friend suffers
from erectile dysfunction."

191
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:16,755
Please, come on already.
I want you to talk to him.

192
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:20,127
Walt should. Skyler, better yet. She'll
kick his butt up and down the block.

193
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:22,316
I think
it ought to be you.

194
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:24,656
You know, tell him
some horror stories.

195
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,408
Maybe show him
some autopsy pictures.

196
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:29,877
What, autopsy for
a pot overdose? Come on.

197
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:32,048
I don't know, baby.
It's just that, you know...

198
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:35,314
I figure his dad should be the one
doing this thing, don't you think?

199
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:38,042
Hank, he respects you.

200
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:44,981
Yeah, all right. Well, listen,
I'll swing by their place after work.

201
00:14:45,262 --> 00:14:46,937
Good. Scare him straight.

202
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:50,504
Where's my sugar?

203
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,570
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am.

204
00:14:57,738 --> 00:15:00,109
You need to be wearing footies
before you try those on.

205
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:01,884
I'm extremely clean.

206
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:04,436
Yeah, well,
I'd really appreciate it.

207
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:09,050
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.

208
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,187
You know, I hid a pair
for you last week, gray ones,

209
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:16,277
but my manager found them, and
we had to put them back on the floor.

210
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:05,866
What do you think?

211
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:07,213
About what?

212
00:16:08,714 --> 00:16:10,525
This look
like a nice place?

213
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:12,474
No, not really.

214
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:14,995
Think you'd like
to live here?

215
00:16:15,794 --> 00:16:16,753
No.

216
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,382
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

217
00:16:20,432 --> 00:16:23,866
I thought we were going
to Cold Stone Creamery.

218
00:16:24,313 --> 00:16:26,189
Well, a little detour.

219
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:29,744
Figured we'd come over here
and check out how the other half lives.

220
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,546
This here's what we call
the Crystal Palace.

221
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,804
Now you know who lives in the palace?
Meth-heads.

222
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:38,961
Nasty, skeevy,
meth-heads

223
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,326
who'd sell their grandma's
coochie for a hit.

224
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:45,259
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh? Yeah.

225
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,828
Well, let me tell you something.
Every last one of these

226
00:16:47,851 --> 00:16:51,101
miserable wastes of skin
got started how?

227
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,645
- How do you think they got started?
- I don't know.

228
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,658
What do you think it was they were
all doing before they graduated

229
00:16:57,673 --> 00:17:00,231
to shooting meth in their...?

230
00:17:02,027 --> 00:17:03,540
A gateway drug.

231
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,750
That's what we call it.

232
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,514
Dollars to doughnuts,
and I shit you not,

233
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,948
that gateway drug
was marijuana.

234
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,521
Every time.

235
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,637
- You understand?
- Um, yeah.

236
00:17:14,674 --> 00:17:17,776
So why are you
telling me this?

237
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,572
'Cause I love you,
you little bastard.

238
00:17:21,346 --> 00:17:23,605
Hey, I was young once,
you know?

239
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:27,527
The world's a messed up place,
you know?

240
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:29,827
You know,
there was this...

241
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:32,624
this one time when...
Hey!

242
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:34,591
Hey! Hey, you!

243
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:36,600
Yeah, you, princess!

244
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:38,369
Get over here!

245
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:43,608
Don't make me
get out of the car!

246
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,788
Check this out.

247
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:51,406
See what I'm talking about.

248
00:17:52,928 --> 00:17:55,629
- I ain't holdin', okay?
- Did I say you could open your mouth?

249
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,462
And hands of the car.

250
00:17:58,215 --> 00:18:00,577
Other side.
Go around the other side.

251
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:02,427
Talk to my friend here.

252
00:18:04,503 --> 00:18:06,528
What's your name,
sweetheart?

253
00:18:07,872 --> 00:18:09,693
- Wendy.
- Wendy, huh?

254
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:12,301
How much you charge
for a windy, Wendy?

255
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:15,571
- I ain't doing him. He's a kid.
- Jesus, was that my question?

256
00:18:15,615 --> 00:18:18,228
Don't think so hard.
It's gonna hurt your brain.

257
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,256
Are you on the pipe
or the needle?

258
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,490
Nothing. Neither.

259
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:23,684
Show us your teeth, huh?

260
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:26,804
Come on, Wendy,
let's see those pearly whites.

261
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,331
Oh, God. See that?

262
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,534
Pipe. Definitely.

263
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:34,556
Big time. Big time
on the pipe.

264
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,518
- You got something you wanna ask Wendy?
- No, not really.

265
00:18:38,677 --> 00:18:41,160
You ever smoke
anything else, Wendy?

266
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:43,066
Sausages don't count.

267
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:46,100
Seriously.

268
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:48,376
Tell my friend here
how you got started.

269
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:50,890
You probably used to be,
what, like, a Girl Scout

270
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:53,975
- or probably sang in a church choir?
- What are you, like, handicapped?

271
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:56,187
He broke his leg
playing football.

272
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:57,875
He's a QB.

273
00:18:58,046 --> 00:18:59,943
Got an arm
like a howitzer.

274
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:04,560
So tell me, Wendy,
do you smoke pot?

275
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:08,015
- Why, you got some?
- All right. Hoof it. Get lost.

276
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:11,637
Get out of here. Hey, fair warning!
Next time I'm gonna bust you!

277
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:21,395
So what do you think?

278
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:24,352
Cool.

279
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,863
Shut the door.

280
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,345
Lock it.
Lock it.

281
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,600
Who the hell was that?

282
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:42,363
A cop and some football player
messing with me.

283
00:19:42,402 --> 00:19:44,813
They ask about me? Huh?

284
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,844
No. I think
they just wanted pot.

285
00:20:04,184 --> 00:20:06,944
Oh, shit.
I left my root beer.

286
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,206
LET HIM LIVE

287
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:19,385
IT'S THE MORAL THING TO DO

288
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,179
WON'T BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH YOURSELF

289
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:30,467
MURDER IS WRONG!

290
00:20:38,462 --> 00:20:42,149
KILL HIM, HE'LL KILL YOU ENTIRE
FAMILY IF YOU LET HIM GO

291
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:56,750
Hello.

292
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,858
Hey, sweetie,
it's me.

293
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,936
Listen, I'm so sorry.

294
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:04,898
The time, it just completely
got away from me there.

295
00:21:07,536 --> 00:21:11,401
My fault. My fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late,

296
00:21:11,494 --> 00:21:14,031
you know, doing
some inventory, and...

297
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,948
I've... I should have just...

298
00:21:17,115 --> 00:21:20,994
You know, you're right.
I gotta learn to say, you know, no!

299
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:23,750
But, um...

300
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:27,353
Sky? You there?

301
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,346
You're at the car wash?

302
00:21:32,644 --> 00:21:33,475
Yeah.

303
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:37,275
I seriously doubt that,

304
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,068
since you quit two weeks ago.

305
00:21:45,812 --> 00:21:48,753
I called Bogdan,
looking for you.

306
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,224
Quite an earful
he gave me.

307
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:55,299
Listen...

308
00:21:57,895 --> 00:22:00,837
Listen, I'll come home,
and we'll talk about it.

309
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,133
I don't think so, Walt.

310
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:04,102
Honey.

311
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:05,848
Wherever you are...

312
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:09,491
why don't you just
stay there tonight?

313
00:22:09,546 --> 00:22:10,569
Skyler?

314
00:22:11,042 --> 00:22:12,072
Skyler?

315
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:15,588
Skyler?

316
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,061
Walter!

317
00:22:22,401 --> 00:22:24,283
Kind of hungry
down here!

318
00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:26,847
Damn.

319
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:30,297
I didn't think
you were coming back.

320
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:46,364
How long was I out?

321
00:24:47,356 --> 00:24:49,146
10, 15 minutes.

322
00:24:51,134 --> 00:24:54,544
I've never seen someone knock
themselves out just by coughing.

323
00:24:54,698 --> 00:24:57,426
You breathe in the same
thing you used on me?

324
00:25:05,973 --> 00:25:07,785
I've got lung cancer.

325
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:34,599
I'll go make you
another sandwich.

326
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:12,740
It's safe.

327
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,836
There's no poison.

328
00:26:16,693 --> 00:26:17,559
Yeah?

329
00:26:19,498 --> 00:26:21,758
Because that'd be
the way to do it...

330
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:23,964
if you're gonna do it.

331
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:27,424
I suppose it would.

332
00:26:28,178 --> 00:26:31,375
I mean, you being
a chemist and all.

333
00:26:49,514 --> 00:26:50,351
So...

334
00:26:51,216 --> 00:26:52,516
that name...

335
00:26:53,894 --> 00:26:55,149
Krazy-8...

336
00:26:56,235 --> 00:26:58,320
Do I really have
to call you that?

337
00:26:58,793 --> 00:27:00,520
I mean, no offense, but...

338
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:03,541
don't you have
a real name?

339
00:27:04,952 --> 00:27:05,953
Domingo.

340
00:27:07,788 --> 00:27:08,768
Domingo.

341
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:12,157
That's "Sunday," right?

342
00:27:14,955 --> 00:27:17,811
I'd rather call you that,
if you don't mind.

343
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:21,138
Yeah, whatever.

344
00:27:21,487 --> 00:27:23,810
I can't say
I ever liked it much.

345
00:27:27,224 --> 00:27:29,568
So, Domingo...

346
00:27:30,522 --> 00:27:34,422
are you from around town
here or someplace else?

347
00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:37,045
Walter,
you getting to know me

348
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:40,026
is not gonna make it
easier for you to kill me.

349
00:27:40,498 --> 00:27:42,842
Not that I mind,
you understand.

350
00:27:44,981 --> 00:27:46,857
You know,
you keep telling me

351
00:27:47,337 --> 00:27:49,815
that I don't have it in me.
Well, maybe.

352
00:27:50,612 --> 00:27:51,997
But maybe not.

353
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:58,763
I sure as hell am looking
for any reason not to.

354
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,235
I mean,
any good reason at all.

355
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:09,451
Sell me.

356
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,329
Tell me what it is.

357
00:28:16,273 --> 00:28:18,223
I guess I'd start off
by promising that,

358
00:28:18,224 --> 00:28:20,567
if you let me go,
I won't come after you.

359
00:28:20,606 --> 00:28:22,269
That you'd be safe.

360
00:28:22,663 --> 00:28:25,369
I guess I'd say what happened
between us...

361
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:27,042
never happened.

362
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,491
And what's best for both parties
is we forget all about it.

363
00:28:31,452 --> 00:28:35,203
But you know that anybody in my
situation would make promises like that.

364
00:28:35,294 --> 00:28:37,681
And though in my case
they happen to be true,

365
00:28:37,837 --> 00:28:39,798
you'd never know
for sure.

366
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:45,400
So what else
can I tell you?

367
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,799
I don't know.

368
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:56,767
But you gotta convince me.

369
00:28:58,066 --> 00:29:01,391
And you're going nowhere
until you do.

370
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,820
Hey, yeah. Yeah.

371
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:08,083
I'm from here
in town, man.

372
00:29:08,899 --> 00:29:11,073
ABQ. Born and bred.

373
00:29:11,577 --> 00:29:12,856
Never left.

374
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:16,996
Studied business
administration over at UNM,

375
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,112
got my degree.

376
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,031
Really?

377
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:27,569
Does that come in handy
in the drug trade?

378
00:29:28,036 --> 00:29:29,528
It doesn't hurt.

379
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:33,122
I was gonna study
music originally.

380
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:36,636
Maybe even try out
for Oberlin or Berklee.

381
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:39,533
My pops talked me
out of it.

382
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,187
Said there was no money in it unless
I wind up some bullshit rock star,

383
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:47,413
and I didn't have
a snowball chance of that, man.

384
00:29:48,449 --> 00:29:50,218
What does your dad do?

385
00:29:51,697 --> 00:29:54,370
He owns Tampico Furniture
over on Menaul.

386
00:29:56,114 --> 00:29:58,406
Wait a minute.
I know that place.

387
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,895
Wait a minute.
That's...

388
00:30:03,257 --> 00:30:05,005
That's that...

389
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,705
They used to have
those late-night...

390
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:11,900
Those stupid commercials.
Yeah, that's him.

391
00:30:12,412 --> 00:30:15,468
- He's been doing 'em for over 30 years.
- Wait a minute.

392
00:30:15,528 --> 00:30:17,531
How did it go?
It was, uh...

393
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,190
Wait, wait, wait.
It was...

394
00:30:22,157 --> 00:30:25,972
Don't let shopping
Strain your brain-o

395
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:30,496
Just sing this short refrain-o

396
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:34,272
Our forniture is bueno

397
00:30:34,422 --> 00:30:37,555
Tampico is the name-o.

398
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,721
Pretty moronic.

399
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:51,294
But what can you do?

400
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,182
It did tend
to stick in your head.

401
00:30:55,525 --> 00:30:59,410
Did you write that,
being the musician of the family?

402
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:01,151
Hell, no, man.

403
00:31:01,256 --> 00:31:03,187
It was my crazy Uncle Alex.

404
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:06,691
He sings it at bars,
trying to pick up on women.

405
00:31:07,353 --> 00:31:09,133
In his mind,
it's like saying,

406
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:11,338
"I wrote Stairway to Heaven."

407
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:15,881
Wait a minute.
Tampico Furniture.

408
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:21,163
I think when my son was born
that we bought his bassinet there.

409
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:25,422
We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a specialty item.

410
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:27,575
We did use
to sell cribs.

411
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:31,222
Oh. Well, a crib, then,
okay? Crib.

412
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,792
Yeah. No, I remember that.

413
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:35,567
In fact,

414
00:31:35,747 --> 00:31:39,584
I remember recognizing your dad
from those commercials.

415
00:31:40,455 --> 00:31:42,139
Although he wasn't...

416
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:44,337
anywhere near as friendly
in real life.

417
00:31:44,338 --> 00:31:45,708
Yeah, no shit.

418
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:49,091
Did he try selling you
that extended warranty?

419
00:31:49,155 --> 00:31:51,009
Yeah, he probably did.

420
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:53,852
And I was probably
dumb enough to buy it.

421
00:31:53,967 --> 00:31:55,909
Yeah, that was
his big thing.

422
00:31:56,234 --> 00:31:57,903
You ask him for
a glass of water,

423
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:01,067
he'll tell you you need
an extended warranty on the ice.

424
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:07,593
- So did you work there, too?
- Only my whole life,

425
00:32:07,862 --> 00:32:10,861
up until the day
I said "fuck you" and quit.

426
00:32:14,737 --> 00:32:15,973
So, uh...

427
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:21,283
16 years ago, how old
would you have been?

428
00:32:22,515 --> 00:32:25,232
It was after school.
Trust me, I was there.

429
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:27,700
Might have even
helped ring you up.

430
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:30,945
You and your extended
warranty on the crib.

431
00:32:40,197 --> 00:32:41,518
Small world.

432
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,923
That it is.

433
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,935
The paths we take, huh?

434
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:13,745
You...

435
00:33:15,004 --> 00:33:16,901
Jesse know you got cancer?

436
00:33:20,234 --> 00:33:21,812
No one but you.

437
00:33:23,964 --> 00:33:25,487
Not your family?

438
00:33:25,722 --> 00:33:26,660
No.

439
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,697
Why not?

440
00:33:33,786 --> 00:33:37,644
Not a conversation I'm even
remotely ready to have.

441
00:33:41,046 --> 00:33:43,177
That's why
you're cooking meth?

442
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,494
You want to leave money
for your family.

443
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:52,287
Hell, I'll write you a check
right now if you let me go.

444
00:33:58,824 --> 00:34:00,529
Like I said, Walter,

445
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:04,355
this line of work
doesn't suit you, man.

446
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,451
Get out
before it's too late.

447
00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:19,826
I don't know what to do.

448
00:34:28,522 --> 00:34:31,229
Yeah. You do.

449
00:34:51,101 --> 00:34:52,629
I'll get the key.

450
00:36:54,657 --> 00:36:56,866
No, don't do this.
Don't do this.

451
00:36:56,878 --> 00:36:58,796
Why are you doing this?

452
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:02,052
Why are you doing this?

453
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:38,296
You're doing
the right thing, Walter.

454
00:37:45,153 --> 00:37:46,612
Do you want to...

455
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:04,892
So... you're not angry?

456
00:38:05,996 --> 00:38:07,456
How do you mean?

457
00:38:08,273 --> 00:38:09,419
Angry?

458
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,667
No.

459
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:14,381
Live and let live, man.

460
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:18,847
That's very understanding.

461
00:38:19,322 --> 00:38:20,835
Whatever, man.

462
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:23,163
I just want to go home.

463
00:38:29,471 --> 00:38:30,558
Me, too.

464
00:38:38,945 --> 00:38:40,501
Unlock me, Walter.

465
00:38:56,707 --> 00:38:58,221
The moment I do...

466
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,491
are you gonna stick me
with that broken piece of plate?

467
00:39:32,313 --> 00:39:33,507
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

468
00:39:47,164 --> 00:39:48,358
I'm sorry.

469
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:50,884
I'm so sorry.

470
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:19,888
Hello?

471
00:41:21,374 --> 00:41:23,058
Anybody down here?

472
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:32,321
Everybody!

473
00:42:34,207 --> 00:42:36,471
I need you all
to take your seats.

474
00:42:36,848 --> 00:42:39,649
Settle down, please.
Thank you.

475
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:42,377
I understand
that Mr. White

476
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:45,386
is feeling a little under
the weather this morning,

477
00:42:45,694 --> 00:42:47,762
so you folks
are going to have

478
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:50,408
to be making do with me today.

479
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,209
And we are going
to be watching

480
00:42:53,218 --> 00:42:56,329
a very interesting video on...

481
00:42:56,971 --> 00:42:58,058
carbon.

482
00:42:59,128 --> 00:43:00,769
Very important stuff.

483
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:07,269
- So what do you think?
- It's a cook site. Gotta be.

484
00:43:07,631 --> 00:43:10,519
Nobody came way the hell
out here just to buy.

485
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:13,839
Fire there could have
started by accident.

486
00:43:13,995 --> 00:43:16,967
Don't look like it was
meant to destroy evidence.

487
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,620
Got a couple of Dually tracks
headed away towards the road.

488
00:43:20,742 --> 00:43:23,957
So, what, they're
in some kind of camper/lab.

489
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:27,495
They accidentally start a fire,
and everybody F.O.'s?

490
00:43:27,573 --> 00:43:29,134
Yeah, why not?

491
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,965
Except why would that little
hair-gelled shit leave his car?

492
00:43:34,687 --> 00:43:36,929
I-yi-yi, Gomie!

493
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:38,897
It's a culture in decline.

494
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:40,487
It's a rich and vibrant culture.

495
00:43:40,509 --> 00:43:42,886
It's a car that
jumps up and down.

496
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:44,881
What the hell?

497
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:48,048
You people used to be conquistadors,
for Christ's sake.

498
00:43:48,115 --> 00:43:51,683
Smells like a Drakkar Noir
factory in here.

499
00:43:52,942 --> 00:43:54,615
I already searched it.

500
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:59,466
You're wasting your time.

501
00:44:00,494 --> 00:44:01,516
Give it up.

502
00:44:01,554 --> 00:44:03,203
If this here's a trap car,

503
00:44:03,215 --> 00:44:06,480
it's gonna take more than
your dumb white ass to find it.

504
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:09,997
You are talking to the trap car
master, my friend.

505
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,413
I'm Rain Man
counting his toothpicks.

506
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:15,451
Yeah, you're like Rain Man.

507
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,878
Retarded.

508
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:25,603
Yeah, baby.

509
00:44:29,402 --> 00:44:31,621
- Hello, Zippy.
- Asshole!

510
00:44:32,747 --> 00:44:35,023
I'd say that looks
like meth, but it's...

511
00:44:35,212 --> 00:44:36,896
it's too damn white.

512
00:44:39,214 --> 00:44:41,539
You know what
I'm thinking, Gomie.

513
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:44,025
Somebody
croaked our snitch.

514
00:44:44,126 --> 00:44:45,553
Hey, agents!

515
00:44:45,832 --> 00:44:47,287
You got something?

516
00:45:22,411 --> 00:45:24,173
I don't know. Just...

517
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:27,532
Doesn't it seem like...

518
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,595
something's missing?

519
00:45:31,047 --> 00:45:32,686
What about the soul?

520
00:45:44,454 --> 00:45:45,882
The soul.

521
00:45:54,201 --> 00:45:56,633
There's nothing
but chemistry here.

522
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:03,136
Skyler.

523
00:47:13,866 --> 00:47:16,454
There's something
I have to tell you.
