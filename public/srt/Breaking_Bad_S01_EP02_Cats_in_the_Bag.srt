1
00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:07,790
Previously on Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:10,253
I don't know what's been
going on with you lately.

3
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:12,040
You understood what
I've just said to you?

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,870
Lung cancer. Inoperable.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,556
You wanna cook crystal meth?
You and me?

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,720
You know the business.
And I know the chemistry.

7
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:22,270
You got crystals in here,
3 inches long.

8
00:00:22,505 --> 00:00:24,677
- What now?
- Run, Mr. White, run!

9
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:28,648
I'll teach you my recipe.
What do you say? You wanna cook like me?

10
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,740
TWELVE HOURS EARLIER

11
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,860
- You are a life saver.
- Yeah, man.

12
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,450
- We can't thank you enough.
- Hey, mad props.

13
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,581
I could have sworn
the guy said south.

14
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:34,740
But then, all of a sudden
we're off the main road.

15
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:38,129
I'm trying to read the map while I'm
driving, which is a bonehead maneuver.

16
00:02:38,134 --> 00:02:40,920
And all of a sudden...
Bam, we're in that ditch.

17
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,400
Yeah, bam,
I'm like, what the hell? You know?

18
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,279
Yes, and my coffee mug.

19
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,400
Coffee? My mug of coffee?

20
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,590
It spills all over my pants.
I mean, just... a nightmare.

21
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:53,510
Dude, you so need GPS.
I mean, for real.

22
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,930
Like I said,

23
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,989
we couldn't be more grateful.

24
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:36,366
Can't we just
dump 'em here?

25
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:38,380
What, then somebody finds them?

26
00:03:38,444 --> 00:03:41,178
Then what?
People have seen us.

27
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:49,490
You're gonna flood it, man.

28
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,870
I'm not gonna flood it.
She's not gonna flood, all right?

29
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,930
We're just gonna stay positive, right?

30
00:03:54,497 --> 00:03:57,200
We're going to clean up this mess.
Wish you would start.

31
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,402
Damn it. See? You flooded it.

32
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:03,090
All right. All right.
You know what?

33
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,290
The RV is going to start now.

34
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,295
The RV is going
to start right now.

35
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:09,970
It's gonna start and we're gonna
drive it over to your house.

36
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,164
- My house?
- Yes.

37
00:04:11,182 --> 00:04:13,370
We'll drive it over there
and park it overnight.

38
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,747
- And then tomorrow...
- No, man, not my house!

39
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:18,517
Shut up!

40
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,010
After we finish
cleaning up this mess,

41
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,073
we will go our separate ways.

42
00:04:36,104 --> 00:04:38,760
Our paths will never cross.

43
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,011
And we will tell this to no one.

44
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,700
Understood?

45
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,114
What, I can talk now?

46
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,117
Fine.

47
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,860
That goes double for me.

48
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,764
Be good to me.

49
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:35,171
Oh, shit.

52
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,027
Walt?

53
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,260
You coming out?

54
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,480
Yeah, absolutely.

55
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:32,719
You wanna hear something funny?

56
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,799
We had a faculty
meeting last Thursday

57
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,980
and the topic was
senior class photos,

58
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:43,249
and how we had instituted
a new rule last year

59
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:45,103
that seniors are allowed to

60
00:06:45,116 --> 00:06:48,340
have photos taken by
a photographer of their choice,

61
00:06:48,385 --> 00:06:52,325
Not necessarily the photographer
that the school hires, right? So...

62
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:58,110
Anyway, some of the senior girls

63
00:06:58,282 --> 00:07:00,203
were going to that...

64
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:03,500
Glamour Shots place,
to have their photos taken,

65
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,628
and now they're bringing us
all these photos,

66
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,620
and Joan Epperman,
you know Joan,

67
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,527
suddenly has to go
through all these photos

68
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:14,292
and turn them down,
because they show cleavage.

69
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,306
Did you get enough
pancakes, sweetie?

70
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,349
Yeah. I'm good.

71
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,233
You know, even these
small-busted girls... have cleavage.

72
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,694
Apparently there's some
new type of brassiere,

73
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:34,106
or something.

74
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:36,267
The Wonderbra...

75
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,160
It's the Wonderbra.

76
00:07:46,737 --> 00:07:50,010
Hey, there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Junior.

77
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:53,570
We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.

78
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,020
Hello, Mr. White.
This is AT&T calling.

79
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:00,129
Are you happy with your
current long distance service?

80
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,952
'Cause if you're not,
I would definitely, really

81
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:05,354
love to talk to you
as soon as possible about...

82
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:07,576
Hello? Hello.
This is Walter White speaking.

83
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:10,089
You said he was
practically dead, okay?

84
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,046
You said he would die any minute!

85
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:15,267
Listen, I am having breakfast
with my family right now,

86
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:18,128
and I really don't appreciate
these sales calls.

87
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,610
Well, too bad, man,
'cause guess what.

88
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,148
He's still not dead!

89
00:08:22,164 --> 00:08:24,961
I went and put my ear to the RV,
I can hear him, like,

90
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:26,931
rolling around in there, all right?

91
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:30,531
I think he's awake, man,
I think he's trying to get loose.

92
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,900
Where the hell are you?
I'm freaking out over here!

93
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,608
- Calm down, damn it.
- Are you gonna help me clean this up?

94
00:08:35,686 --> 00:08:38,551
- We got loose ends here!
- Calm down!

95
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:40,160
I will be there after school.

96
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,620
After school?
Are you shitting me?

97
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:44,739
Ditch it, man, call in sick.

98
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,287
Listen, that is just not
going to work for me.

99
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,040
I'm not interested in that at all.

100
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,340
And I would appreciate
if you don't call here anymore.

101
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:55,134
Damn. They're so annoying,
those people.

102
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,980
- You have a good day, sweetie.
- Okay, Mom. You too.

103
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,928
Bye, honey.

104
00:09:09,787 --> 00:09:11,435
- Drive safe.
- Okay.

105
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:27,343
Yo, yo, yo, 148-3369,

106
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,058
representing the ABQ.

107
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,610
What up, biatch?

108
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,486
Leave it at the tone.

109
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:51,109
So, the term "chiral"

110
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:54,888
derives from
the Greek word "hand."

111
00:09:55,814 --> 00:09:59,755
The concept here being that,
just as your left hand,

112
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,137
and your right hand are
mirror images of one another, right?

113
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,300
Identical, and yet opposite.

114
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:10,109
Well, so too organic
compounds can exist as

115
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:12,166
mirror image forms

116
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:15,242
of one another all the way down
at the molecular level.

117
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:18,970
But although
they may look the same,

118
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:22,486
they don't always
behave the same.

119
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:24,094
For instance...

120
00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:33,240
I'm sorry...
For instance...

121
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:35,444
Thalidomide.

122
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:40,238
The right-handed isomer
of the drug Thalidomide

123
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:44,080
is a perfectly fine good medicine
to give to a pregnant woman

124
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:46,764
to prevent morning sickness but,

125
00:10:46,864 --> 00:10:49,696
make the mistake of giving
that same pregnant woman

126
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:53,229
the left-handed isomer
of the drug Thalidomide,

127
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:56,798
and her child
will be born with

128
00:10:56,898 --> 00:10:58,868
horrible birth defects.

129
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:03,920
Which is precisely
what happened in the 1950s.

130
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,084
So, chiral, chirality,

131
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,448
mirrored images, right?

132
00:11:10,884 --> 00:11:12,821
Active, inactive.

133
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,570
Good, bad.

134
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:21,464
Yes, Ben?

135
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:23,894
Is this gonna be on the murder?

136
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:27,000
What?

137
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:29,516
Is this gonna be on the mid-term?

138
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:35,930
The chirality on the mid-term?
No, no, well, maybe,

139
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:38,464
maybe, yes, you know,
but prepare

140
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,320
for it to be on the mid-term.

141
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,626
Can't hurt to know it, right?

142
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:44,649
Knowledge is power!

143
00:13:00,515 --> 00:13:02,184
Oh, no, no...

144
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,800
Not good. Not good.

145
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:32,542
What the...

146
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:56,345
Hey, you.

147
00:13:57,547 --> 00:13:59,557
Listen...
No, no, no, no!

148
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:05,648
Oh, God!

149
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,500
MILF's?

150
00:15:08,494 --> 00:15:10,640
What the hell is a MILF?

151
00:15:28,726 --> 00:15:30,112
Now what?

152
00:15:34,614 --> 00:15:37,250
The other one,
out in the RV, he's...

153
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,951
- You're sure?
- Yes.

154
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:40,859
Positive?

155
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:43,412
- Feel free to go check it yourself.
- Yes, good idea.

156
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:46,406
Maybe I should do that before he, too,
wanders off on the damn street!

157
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,137
- Okay, you know what, I...
- All right, all right!

158
00:15:50,586 --> 00:15:53,038
The one downstairs,
tell me about him.

159
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:55,395
Come on, anything, something!

160
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:58,192
- Start with his name, at least!
- Krazy-8.

161
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:00,777
Krazy-8?
What the hell does that even mean?

162
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:03,424
I don't know, man, okay?
I mean, he's like,

163
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:05,549
Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.

164
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:08,400
So, you work with him regularly?

165
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,566
No, not him so much.

166
00:16:10,654 --> 00:16:13,206
- His cousin, mainly.
- Who's his cousin?

167
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,131
- The guy out in the RV!
- All right, all right.

168
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:18,456
Krazy-8's one level higher.

169
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:20,370
One level higher?

170
00:16:20,441 --> 00:16:22,360
Yeah, you know,
not like street level.

171
00:16:22,587 --> 00:16:23,790
Higher.

172
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,908
You know, there's like
a Starbucks at every corner?

173
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:30,394
Krazy-8 is, like, the dude
that sells Starbucks his beans.

174
00:16:30,686 --> 00:16:32,756
Okay, so he's a distributor.

175
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:35,756
Okay, so, is he...

176
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,965
I mean, is he...
In other words...

177
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:41,994
What is his reputation for violence?

178
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:44,461
Well, um...

179
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,689
He did try to kill us both
yesterday, so there's that.

180
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:50,910
What I'm trying to say
is that he's a distributor, right?

181
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,198
He's a... He's a businessman,
he's a man of business.

182
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,429
It would therefore seem to follow
that he is capable of acting

183
00:16:57,445 --> 00:17:00,055
out of mutual self-interest, yes?

184
00:17:00,973 --> 00:17:01,857
What?

185
00:17:01,993 --> 00:17:04,582
Do you think he is capable

186
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,048
of listening to reason?

187
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:08,983
What kind of reason?

188
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,729
Like "Dear Krazy-8, listen,

189
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,851
"if I let you go, will you promise not
to come back and waste my family?

190
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,576
"No Colombian neckties."
You mean that kind of reason?

191
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,432
No, man, I can't say as I have
high hopes where that's concerned.

192
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:27,603
What was that?

193
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,258
What was what?

194
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:36,058
Come see!

195
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,860
We gotta tie him up.

196
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,302
Why the hell didn't we tie him up?

197
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,100
Because he was out cold.

198
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:45,366
But what if he's faking it?

199
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:49,085
Like if it was me, I'd be all
faking being knocked out, yo!

200
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:51,769
And then,
when the coast is clear,

201
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,180
I'd be up looking
for weapons and shit,

202
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:55,859
waiting to pounce!

203
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,443
Now if it was me, and I couldn't
find a decent enough weapon,

204
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:26,658
I would just lie back down,
and bide my time.

205
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,310
So now what do we do?

206
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,102
You keep asking me that

207
00:19:30,464 --> 00:19:33,580
like you think
I have some answer.

208
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,494
- Well, you gotta do something!
- We!

209
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,798
We have got to do something,
and I am opened to suggestions.

210
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:43,566
Man, uh-uh, okay,
this whole thing was your deal!

211
00:19:43,578 --> 00:19:45,760
Don't you dare put that on me!

212
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:49,035
You brought those guys out there,
this is your responsability!

213
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:51,835
Like I came to you,
begging to cook meth.

214
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:56,337
"Nerdiest old dude I know,
you wanna come cook crystal?" Please!

215
00:19:56,396 --> 00:20:00,313
"I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny, but
her wheelchair wouldn't fit in the RV."

216
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:10,223
What about the...
the phosphate gas?

217
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:12,839
Phosphine gas.
What about it?

218
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:15,780
I mean, do you think
it still might kill him?

219
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:18,497
You know, with like
a delayed reaction or something?

220
00:20:21,156 --> 00:20:22,200
I don't know.

221
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,012
- You're supposed to be a scientist!
- Look!

222
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:28,770
This isn't even the issue
that demands immediate attention.

223
00:20:29,418 --> 00:20:32,011
We have got a body in that RV,

224
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:34,595
and it's getting warmer
outside, understand?

225
00:20:34,715 --> 00:20:37,840
And we have got to do something
about that soon.

226
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,640
And in a way that
no one will ever find it.

227
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,889
Now that last part

228
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,482
is very, very important.

229
00:20:45,922 --> 00:20:47,140
Therefore,

230
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,394
it seems to me that
our best course of action

231
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,767
would be chemical disincorporation.

232
00:20:59,678 --> 00:21:02,231
Dissolving in strong acid.

233
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,625
Oh man, that's messed up.

234
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:15,761
You're not...
You're not serious?

235
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:19,948
You're serious?

236
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:29,290
Who's gonna do that?

237
00:21:29,464 --> 00:21:31,302
And don't look at me!

238
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,900
I guess we'll both do it together.

239
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,128
No, Mr. White, okay,
I'm not good with dead bodies.

240
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:43,830
We're in this 50/50, okay?

241
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,875
I guess the only
other fair way

242
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,495
to go about this would be...

243
00:21:52,697 --> 00:21:55,853
that one of us deals with the...

244
00:21:56,395 --> 00:21:59,735
body situation,
while the other one of us...

245
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:03,390
deals with the Krazy-8 situation.

246
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:12,880
In a scenario like this,

247
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,220
I don't suppose
it is bad form to just...

248
00:22:17,715 --> 00:22:19,303
flip a coin.

249
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:30,640
- Heads or tails?
- I'll do the body in the acid, okay?

250
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,124
Heads or tails?

251
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,000
Heads.

252
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,234
Best two out of three?

253
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,538
Yo, yo, yo, 148-3369,

254
00:23:23,553 --> 00:23:25,227
representing the ABQ.

255
00:23:25,263 --> 00:23:26,745
What up, biatch?

256
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:28,545
Leave it at the tone.

257
00:23:29,631 --> 00:23:31,540
Mr. White, it's me, pick up.

258
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:34,661
I got a container question.

259
00:23:36,189 --> 00:23:39,003
Hello? Mr. White,
pick up the phone, man!

260
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:39,975
Yes?

261
00:23:40,056 --> 00:23:41,722
What kind of plastic, man?

262
00:23:41,744 --> 00:23:43,636
Polyethylene.

263
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,150
How the hell
am I supposed to know that?

264
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,900
Because I told you.

265
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,633
Look, just...

266
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:55,154
look at the bottom
for a triangle

267
00:23:55,656 --> 00:23:57,809
stamped "LDPE."

268
00:23:57,822 --> 00:24:00,022
It should be molded
right into the plastic.

269
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,405
Yeah, yeah, LDPE.
Right on, got it.

270
00:24:02,772 --> 00:24:06,682
But... I don't know, man,
this feels kind of flimsy.

271
00:24:07,234 --> 00:24:09,871
Any decent acid's gonna
eat right through this.

272
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,380
- Not hydrofluoric.
- Why not?

273
00:24:14,364 --> 00:24:17,379
Look, you skipped,

274
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,974
clowned around
or otherwise jerked off

275
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:22,386
to every lecture I ever gave.

276
00:24:22,537 --> 00:24:25,914
As far as I'm concerned,
your chemistry education is over.

277
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,161
Oh, okay.
Be a dick about it.

278
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:32,560
So, hey, have you...

279
00:24:34,044 --> 00:24:36,034
Have you done the thing?

280
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,773
Yeah, I'm working up to it.

281
00:24:47,147 --> 00:24:50,190
You know what?
I bet he doesn't even wake up.

282
00:24:51,928 --> 00:24:55,265
Not even if you took him
to the hospital right now.

283
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,608
Now, if it was me, I would just
try and think of it like I was...

284
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,440
I was doing him a favor.

285
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:12,314
Who's there?

286
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:18,840
Don't you fucking play games
with me. Who's there?

287
00:27:23,148 --> 00:27:25,379
Yeah, I see you.

288
00:27:28,656 --> 00:27:30,485
What are you gonna do?

289
00:27:42,376 --> 00:27:44,004
I need water!

290
00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:50,590
Bring me some water, would you?

291
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,107
Please?

292
00:29:07,361 --> 00:29:09,190
You don't like the crust?

293
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,550
Where's my cousin Emilio?

294
00:29:26,976 --> 00:29:28,182
He dead?

295
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,913
Hey, Mr. White!

296
00:31:22,976 --> 00:31:24,363
Mr. White?

297
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,380
Are you smoking weed?

298
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,940
Oh, my God!

299
00:31:35,234 --> 00:31:37,486
Wait a minute.
Is that my weed?

300
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:40,965
What the hell, man?

301
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,747
Make yourself at home,
why don't you?

302
00:31:46,895 --> 00:31:48,950
So what did you end up buying?

303
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:50,892
Nothing.

304
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,919
No store in town sells a plastic bin
big enough for a body.

305
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:00,654
I don't suppose you could
buy two bins...

306
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:08,181
Legs in one,
torso in the other?

307
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,043
God.

308
00:32:11,484 --> 00:32:13,997
I don't suppose
you could kiss my ass?

309
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,195
How did it go?

310
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,110
So you didn't do it?

311
00:32:37,673 --> 00:32:38,979
Not yet.

312
00:32:40,495 --> 00:32:41,445
God.

313
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,062
- I gotta go.
- What? No, come back here!

314
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,505
Sorry.
I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.

315
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:53,650
Tomorrow?

316
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,780
I've got a doctor's appointement,
I gotta go.

317
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,629
Look, stay away from him.

318
00:32:58,412 --> 00:32:59,690
He's awake.

319
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,471
Hey, man, we flipped a coin.

320
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:08,540
We flipped a coin!

321
00:33:14,277 --> 00:33:15,701
We're good?

322
00:33:16,924 --> 00:33:18,609
We're very good.

323
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,793
We're excellent, I'd say.

324
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,625
Oh, would you look at that face!

325
00:33:28,265 --> 00:33:30,255
Smile, peanut!

326
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,606
So, who's up for knowing?

327
00:33:44,378 --> 00:33:45,423
Girl.

328
00:33:45,532 --> 00:33:46,597
Girl?

329
00:33:47,474 --> 00:33:49,424
- You sure?
- Pretty sure.

330
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:57,659
Can I tell you this is exactly
what I was hoping?

331
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:02,790
You remember you said that
when she's 16 and starts dating.

332
00:34:03,721 --> 00:34:05,369
Looking fabulous.

333
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:08,916
Let me see if they're done with the
blood sugar, then we'll get you out.

334
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:10,493
I'll be right back.

335
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,689
Who is Jesse Pinkman?

336
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,082
Jesse...

337
00:34:49,331 --> 00:34:50,697
Jesse Pinkman.

338
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:57,348
He called just this morning,
Walt, please don't deny it.

339
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:02,240
It says on his MyShout page
he attended Wynne.

340
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,063
Was he one of your students?

341
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:05,881
Yeah. He was...

342
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:08,143
nobody.

343
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,729
Who is he to you?

344
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,634
Why is he calling?
What is this big secret

345
00:35:14,637 --> 00:35:18,238
you seem to be discussing
with some... druggie burn-out?

346
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:24,057
You don't come home

347
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,529
last night until 2 in the morning,
you don't tell me where you've been.

348
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,336
You spent the entire night
in the bathroom, Walt.

349
00:35:31,873 --> 00:35:34,472
Tell me what's going on with you.

350
00:35:35,328 --> 00:35:37,403
Don't you think you owe me that?

351
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:43,350
Who's this Jesse Pinkman to you?

352
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,499
He sells me pot.

353
00:35:53,547 --> 00:35:56,220
He sells you... pot?

354
00:35:56,871 --> 00:35:58,499
Marijuana, yeah.

355
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:00,094
Not a lot.

356
00:36:00,215 --> 00:36:02,202
I mean, I don't know.

357
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,198
I kinda like it.

358
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,485
Are you out of your mind?

359
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,193
What are you,
like 16 years old?

360
00:36:12,245 --> 00:36:14,853
Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent.

361
00:36:14,878 --> 00:36:17,035
What is wrong with you?

362
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,804
Skyler...

363
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:26,395
I just...

364
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:29,611
haven't quite been myself lately.

365
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,441
Yeah, no shit.
Thanks for noticing.

366
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:36,384
I haven't been myself
lately, but I love you.

367
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:39,970
Nothing about that has changed.

368
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,264
Nothing ever will.

369
00:36:42,972 --> 00:36:45,929
So right now,
what I need

370
00:36:46,374 --> 00:36:49,869
is for you to climb down
out of my ass.

371
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,321
Can you do that?

372
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:57,760
Will you do that for me, honey?

373
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,976
Will you, please, just once,

374
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,689
get off my ass?

375
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,805
You know, I'd appreciate it.

376
00:37:08,141 --> 00:37:09,568
I really would.

377
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,646
Stop!

378
00:37:41,015 --> 00:37:43,467
Stop in 15 minutes.

379
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,033
Just meat, is all.
Just a bunch of meat.

380
00:38:43,492 --> 00:38:44,879
Oh, Jesus.

381
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,800
It's cool, you're cool.

382
00:38:51,891 --> 00:38:53,679
You're all good, yo.

383
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,443
You're all good in the hood.

384
00:38:56,482 --> 00:39:00,408
It's fine. Just a bunch of meat,
come on. You got it.

385
00:39:23,881 --> 00:39:25,001
Excuse me!

386
00:39:26,256 --> 00:39:27,382
Excuse me?

387
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,365
You.

388
00:39:28,837 --> 00:39:29,990
Yes, you.

389
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,670
May I talk to you?

390
00:39:35,717 --> 00:39:37,050
This is private property!

391
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,900
Just a minute.
I wanna talk to you.

392
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,200
No, I'm not interested.

393
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:44,080
Hey, don't touch me!
Do not touch me.

394
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,770
All right, look, not touching, okay?
Not touching here.

395
00:39:46,823 --> 00:39:49,700
Look, lady, whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying, yo.

396
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,447
Well, my name is Skyler White, yo.

397
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,419
My husband is Walter White, yo.

398
00:39:57,873 --> 00:39:59,623
He told me everything.

399
00:40:00,062 --> 00:40:02,256
- Seriously?
- That's right.

400
00:40:03,053 --> 00:40:04,841
And just so you know...

401
00:40:05,672 --> 00:40:09,048
My brother-in-law is a DEA agent.

402
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,616
And I will not hesitate to call him.

403
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,555
Not if I have to.

404
00:40:13,951 --> 00:40:15,137
Understood?

405
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,736
This is your one
and only warning.

406
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:23,379
Do not sell marijuana
to my husband.

407
00:40:26,043 --> 00:40:27,805
- Okay.
- I mean it.

408
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:29,945
Don't call our house again.

409
00:40:30,106 --> 00:40:33,772
You stay away from him,
or you'll be one sorry individual.

410
00:40:35,896 --> 00:40:37,223
You got me?

411
00:40:38,533 --> 00:40:39,998
I think so, yeah.

412
00:40:40,283 --> 00:40:42,063
No more marijuana.

413
00:40:42,711 --> 00:40:44,070
I can dig it.

414
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,958
You can dig it.

415
00:40:46,462 --> 00:40:47,547
Wonderful.

416
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,462
Not that it's any of my business,

417
00:41:00,514 --> 00:41:03,931
but you might wanna consider
a different line of work.

418
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,457
Okay.

419
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,041
"Let's go to your house, yo!

420
00:42:04,504 --> 00:42:06,976
"Makes perfect sense. Let's...

421
00:42:07,848 --> 00:42:10,882
"Let's completely
screw up your house

422
00:42:11,092 --> 00:42:13,337
"so you never wanna
spend another night in it."

423
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,621
"Sure.
You know, why not?"

424
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,680
"And then, how's about I send over
my psycho-bitch wife to...

425
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,310
"you know, break your balls
and threaten you?

426
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,219
"God, that'd be hilarious."

427
00:42:29,259 --> 00:42:31,711
"And then, the killer
in the basement?

428
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:35,064
"The one who's completely
my responsabilty.

429
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:38,548
"Hell, let's just let him
live down there.

430
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:42,360
"Just, I don't know,
make sure to feed him, like...

431
00:42:42,871 --> 00:42:44,580
"three times a day."

432
00:42:45,786 --> 00:42:47,250
"Sure, why not?

433
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,900
"That would be amazing.

434
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,915
"Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

435
00:42:50,997 --> 00:42:54,354
"I always dreamt about,
I don't know, melting bodies."

436
00:43:18,537 --> 00:43:21,480
You got a brother
in the goddamned DEA?

437
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:25,949
What?

438
00:43:25,965 --> 00:43:27,875
You said you were just
doing some ride-along.

439
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,813
Yes or no, do you have
a brother in the DEA?

440
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,857
Brother-in-law.

441
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:36,279
Now there's a load off my mind.

442
00:43:36,331 --> 00:43:38,005
Where did you hear that?

443
00:43:38,251 --> 00:43:41,890
Your freaking wife told me
when she was here all up on my shit.

444
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,270
Yeah, that's right.

445
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,680
She almost caught me
moving Emilio!

446
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,512
Good job in wearing
the pants in the family.

447
00:43:49,648 --> 00:43:53,045
And why did you go and tell her
I was selling you weed?

448
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:57,364
Because somehow,
it seemed preferable to admitting

449
00:43:57,365 --> 00:44:00,339
that I cook crystal meth
and killed a man.

450
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,214
Is that what I think it is?

451
00:44:11,268 --> 00:44:13,640
Yeah, it is.
I smoked a bowl, so what?

452
00:44:13,726 --> 00:44:15,394
My house, my rules.

453
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:18,880
Hey, no, no! Don't give me that, okay?
I held up my end.

454
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,892
I already took care of Emilio.

455
00:44:20,969 --> 00:44:23,380
You're still diddling around,
trying to get your nut up.

456
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:27,168
Well, boo-hoo.
I have the truly awful job here.

457
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,374
You wanna talk awful?
You wanna go there?

458
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:33,335
Try dragging 200 pounds
of stink up a flight of stairs.

459
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,896
I barely got him in the bathtub!

460
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:37,874
Bathtub? What...

461
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,920
- What do you mean, "bathtub"?
- That's another thing,

462
00:44:40,926 --> 00:44:42,577
Why you got me
running around town,

463
00:44:42,586 --> 00:44:44,926
trying to find some
stupid piece of plastic,

464
00:44:44,937 --> 00:44:47,694
when I have a perfectly
good tub I can use?

465
00:44:51,035 --> 00:44:52,391
Oh, God.

466
00:45:50,942 --> 00:45:52,935
I'm sorry,
what were you asking me?

467
00:45:52,993 --> 00:45:54,264
Oh, yes.

468
00:45:54,568 --> 00:45:57,939
That stupid plastic container
I asked you to buy.

469
00:45:59,076 --> 00:46:02,483
You see, hydrofluoric acid
won't eat through plastic.

470
00:46:02,904 --> 00:46:06,145
It will however dissolve
metal, rock,

471
00:46:06,234 --> 00:46:08,452
glass, ceramic.

472
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,148
So there's that.

9999
