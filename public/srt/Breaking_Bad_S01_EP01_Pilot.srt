1
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:17,187
My name is
Walter Hartwell White.
@mergeUp

2
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:20,252
I live at
308 Negra Arroyo Lane,
@mergeUp

3
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,878
Albuquerque, New Mexico,
87104.
@mergeUp

4
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:26,344
To all law enforcement entitles,
this is not an admission of guilt.
@mergeUp

5
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:29,144
I am speaking
to my family now.
@mergeUp

6
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:37,552
Skyler...
@mergeUp

7
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:40,224
you are the love
of my life.
@mergeUp

8
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:42,406
I hope you know that.
@mergeUp

9
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:45,652
Walter, Junior...

10
00:02:46,362 --> 00:02:47,768
you're my big man.

11
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:50,107
There are...

12
00:02:50,196 --> 00:02:52,180
There are going
to be some...

13
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,221
things... things...

14
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:58,052
that you'll come to learn
about me in the next few days.

15
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,100
I just want you to know

16
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,076
that no... no matter
how it may look,

17
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,628
I only had you in my heart.

18
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,376
Good-bye.

21
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:14,868
Happy Birthday.

22
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,509
Look at that.

23
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,454
That is veggie bacon.

24
00:05:22,248 --> 00:05:24,012
Believe it or not.
Zero cholesterol.

25
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:26,415
You won't even taste
the difference.

26
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:29,249
What time do you think
you'll be home?

27
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,317
Same time.

28
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,672
I don't want him dicking
you around tonight.

29
00:05:32,747 --> 00:05:35,850
You get paid till 5,
you work till 5, no later.

30
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:38,873
Hey.

31
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,200
- Happy Birthday.
- Well, thank you.

32
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:44,188
You're late... again.

33
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:47,192
There was no
hot water... again.

34
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:49,015
I have an easy fix
for that.

35
00:05:49,157 --> 00:05:50,621
You wake up early,

36
00:05:50,756 --> 00:05:53,646
and then you get to be
the first person in the shower.

37
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,288
I have an idea.

38
00:05:57,445 --> 00:06:01,027
How about buy
a new hot water heater?

39
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:02,475
How's that idea?

40
00:06:02,547 --> 00:06:05,266
For the millionth
and billionth time.

41
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,522
- Did you take your Echinacea?
- Yeah.

42
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:12,397
I think it's getting better.

43
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:15,490
What the hell is this?

44
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:19,471
It's veggie bacon.
We're watching our cholesterol, I guess.

45
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:21,478
Not me.
I want real bacon.

46
00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:23,275
Not this fake crap.

47
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,430
Too bad.

48
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:25,579
Eat it.

49
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,481
This smells
like Band-aids.

50
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,585
Eat... it.

51
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,852
So, how's it feel
to be old?

52
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,464
How does it feel
to be a smart ass?

53
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:41,794
Good.

54
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,534
Eat your veggie bacon.

55
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,296
- You all set?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

56
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:08,949
- All right, see you at home.
- Okay, see you.

57
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:13,890
Chemistry.

58
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:17,094
It is the study of what?

59
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:19,659
Anyone?

60
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,213
Ben.

61
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:25,168
- Chemicals.
- Chemicals!

62
00:07:25,948 --> 00:07:26,866
No!

63
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,004
Chemistry is...

64
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:32,296
Well, technically,

65
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:35,051
chemistry is
the study of matter.

66
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:39,317
But I prefer to see it
as the study of change.

67
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:41,720
Now just...
just think about this.

68
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,098
Electrons.

69
00:07:43,828 --> 00:07:44,806
They...

70
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,609
change their energy levels.

71
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:48,801
Molecules.

72
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,994
Molecules change
their bonds.

73
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:54,023
Elements.

74
00:07:54,164 --> 00:07:56,658
They combine
and change into compounds.

75
00:07:57,842 --> 00:08:00,199
Well, that's...
that's all of life.

76
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,706
Right? I mean, it's just...
It's the constant.

77
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:05,228
It's the cycle.
It's solution,

78
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,217
dissolution, just over
and over and over.

79
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:12,247
It is growth, then decay,
then transformation.

80
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:18,130
It is fascinating, really.

81
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:25,337
Chad...

82
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:29,579
Is there something
wrong with your table?

83
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,272
Okay.
Ionic bonds...

84
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,344
Are you done?

85
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:49,313
Ionic bonds.

86
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:50,930
Chapter 6.

87
00:09:02,591 --> 00:09:05,370
And 2, 3 makes 10,
and 10 makes 20.

88
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:06,811
Here's your receipt,

89
00:09:06,816 --> 00:09:09,194
and hand this claiming disc
to your car wash professional.

90
00:09:09,223 --> 00:09:11,000
Thank you.
Come again.

91
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:23,930
He's not coming.

92
00:09:23,956 --> 00:09:25,411
He said he quits.

93
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:28,192
I'm gonna run
the register.

94
00:09:28,362 --> 00:09:30,806
Bogdan, no.
We talked about this.

95
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,409
I'm shorthanded, Walter.

96
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:33,813
What am I to do?

97
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,277
Walter?

98
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,660
What am I to do?

99
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:02,493
Hey, Mr. White!

100
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:05,969
Make those tires
shine, huh?

101
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,282
Oh, my God.

102
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:10,718
You would not believe
who's cleaning Chad's car.

103
00:10:10,797 --> 00:10:12,099
Mr. White...

104
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:13,895
from Chemistry.

105
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,836
Surprise!

106
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:37,558
Happy Birthday, Dad!

107
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:43,768
You're so very late.

108
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,837
Really, I'm serious,
Skyler.

109
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:49,372
I mean, you're flat
as a washboard.

110
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:51,537
You look awesome.

111
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,543
She's not showing
at all, is she?

112
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:55,042
She's showing
a little.

113
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:58,818
Carmen, this is
my sister Marie.

114
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:01,338
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

115
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:05,420
Glock 22.
It's my daily carry, okay?

116
00:11:05,643 --> 00:11:08,523
I mean, unless you're talking,
what, plus, B-plus loads,

117
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:10,448
you can forget
the 9-mil, all right?

118
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:13,109
I seen one of those
bounce off a windshield one time.

119
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:15,018
Yeah, the way you shoot.

120
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:17,158
If you're gonna
bring a gun,

121
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,854
you gotta bring
enough gun.

122
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:20,100
.40 caliber.

123
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:24,169
- This is awesome right here.
- Nice, isn't it?

124
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:26,229
Dad, come check
this out.

125
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,485
- Yeah, I see it.
- Come on, take it.

126
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:30,088
Check it out, Walt.

127
00:11:31,664 --> 00:11:33,594
No, no,
it's just heavy.

128
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:35,413
That's why they hire men.

129
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,363
It's not gonna
bite you, all right?

130
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,128
Looks like Keith Richards
with a glass of warm milk, doesn't he?

131
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,891
Hey, Walt. Everybody listen up,
listen up, listen up!

132
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,185
I'm gonna give a toast.

133
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:49,708
A little toast to my brother-in-law.
Come here.

134
00:11:50,245 --> 00:11:53,797
Walt, you got a brain
the size of Wisconsin,

135
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:56,874
but we're not gonna
hold that against you.

136
00:11:57,181 --> 00:11:59,102
Because your heart's
in the right place, man.

137
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,551
Your heart's
in the right place.

138
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,002
We love you, man.
We love you.

139
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:03,595
Everybody!
To Walt!

140
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,538
Na zdorovje!

141
00:12:04,553 --> 00:12:05,852
Na zdorovje!

142
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,181
Hey,
turn on Channel 3.

143
00:12:13,572 --> 00:12:15,583
At which point we apprehended
three individuals

144
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:17,299
and placed them into custody.

145
00:12:17,526 --> 00:12:19,562
I'm proud to say
the outstanding

146
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:21,649
professionalism
of my fellow agents

147
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,534
at the Albuquerque
District Office

148
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,358
resulted in
a substantial amount

149
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:27,796
of methamphetamine
being taken off the streets.

150
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,171
Were any shots fired?

151
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:31,819
No, ma'am. Our agents took
the suspects by surprise.

152
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:34,476
Damn, the TV does
add ten pounds.

153
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:36,196
Ten pounds?

154
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,704
Hey, sit and spin.
Both of you.

155
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:40,368
- Hank.
- What?

156
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:43,556
Sorry.
You didn't see that.

157
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,309
So charming.

158
00:12:45,352 --> 00:12:47,422
This is clearly
an ongoing operation,

159
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:49,653
one which was
well organized...

160
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:51,158
Hank, how much
money is that?

161
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:53,510
It's about 700 grand.
That's a pretty good haul, huh?

162
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:56,674
As I say, it's a good day
for the citizens of Albuquerque

163
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,666
when we can put this big a dent
in the local drug trade.

164
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:02,898
But that's unusual,
isn't it, that kind of cash?

165
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:05,213
Well, it's not the most
we ever took.

166
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:06,550
It's easy money...

167
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:08,200
until we catch you.

168
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:11,539
Walt, just say the word
and I'll take you on a ride-along.

169
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:13,849
You can watch us
knock down a meth lab.

170
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:16,008
Get a little excitement
in your life.

171
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:18,126
Well, someday.

172
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:28,890
Which one's this?

173
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:30,928
That faux-Lalique vase

174
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:32,952
I picked up
at the Super-Swap.

175
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:39,712
How's it doing?

176
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,252
I met my reserve,

177
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:43,338
and there's still
two minutes.

178
00:13:50,557 --> 00:13:51,707
What's up?

179
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,752
You tell me,
birthday boy.

180
00:13:57,348 --> 00:13:59,747
Oh, hey, so what's up
for Saturday?

181
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:01,846
Car wash.

182
00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:03,500
Bogdan says
he needs me.

183
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:05,573
Until what time?
Noon? 1-ish?

184
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:07,471
Probably 2,
more like it.

185
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:10,046
And then what
after that?

186
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:13,175
Actually...

187
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:16,260
I was thinking
of driving

188
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:18,082
up to Los Alamos.

189
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,182
The visitor center
has an exhibit on...

190
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:22,870
It's really supposed
to be...

191
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:25,402
- You're not gonna paint?
- I'll paint.

192
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,121
It's just that this...

193
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:30,872
part of this exhibition on the...

194
00:14:31,132 --> 00:14:33,296
Mars Rover
photographs are...

195
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:37,750
The detail really is just
supposed to be amazing.

196
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:40,254
It's just that I really need you
to paint at some point.

197
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:43,444
I mean, the sooner that
back bedroom gets finished.

198
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,301
And I'd do it myself, except
you said you don't want me

199
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,310
- standing on the stepladder.
- I'll paint. I will paint.

200
00:14:52,612 --> 00:14:54,602
What is going on
down there?

201
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:57,332
- No, it's just...
- Is he asleep?

202
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:01,200
No, It's nothing.
You know, just...

203
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:02,648
You know,

204
00:15:02,988 --> 00:15:04,932
we gotta be careful
about the baby.

205
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:07,938
Don't worry about the baby.
This is just for you.

206
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:11,440
We are just
doing you tonight.

207
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
So just close your eyes.

208
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:17,587
Relax, and let it...

209
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,058
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

210
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:28,379
There you go.

211
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:30,173
That's it.

212
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:32,244
That's it.

213
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:35,102
There you go.

214
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:37,492
Keep it going.

215
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:39,749
Keep it going.

216
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:42,726
Keep it going.

217
00:15:43,832 --> 00:15:45,519
Keep... Yes!

218
00:15:45,823 --> 00:15:47,054
56!

219
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:39,240
This is so embarrassing.

220
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:40,942
I am fine. Honestly.

221
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:43,689
It's just some bug
going around.

222
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:46,379
First my wife had it,
then my son, and now me.

223
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,930
It's just like
a chest cold.

224
00:16:50,671 --> 00:16:52,693
Could be some
low blood sugar as well.

225
00:16:52,698 --> 00:16:55,691
I didn't have the greatest
breakfast this morning, honestly.

226
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,961
Hey, listen, can you do me a favor?
Can you just...

227
00:16:59,204 --> 00:17:01,338
drop me off
at a corner somewhere?

228
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:04,084
No. Sorry.

229
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,722
It's just that I don't have
the greatest insurance.

230
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:09,978
Take a couple
of deep breaths for me.

231
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:18,764
Is there anybody you want us
to contact for you?

232
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:20,046
God, no.

233
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:22,563
Lean forward for me,
would you?

234
00:17:25,748 --> 00:17:27,537
Mr. White,
are you a smoker?

235
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:29,283
No. Never.

236
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,208
Why do you ask?

237
00:18:12,006 --> 00:18:13,006
Mr. White.

238
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:15,862
Mr. White?

239
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:18,532
Yes.

240
00:18:20,222 --> 00:18:22,700
You understood what
I've just said to you?

241
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,811
Yes.

242
00:18:24,485 --> 00:18:26,423
Lung cancer.
Inoperable.

243
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,199
I'm sorry...

244
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:33,523
I just need to make sure
you fully understand.

245
00:18:34,384 --> 00:18:36,617
Best-case scenario,
with chemo,

246
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:39,348
I'll live maybe
another couple years.

247
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:43,013
It's just...

248
00:18:43,845 --> 00:18:46,442
you've got mustard
on your...

249
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:50,408
Right there.
Mustard, there.

250
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:51,807
Right there.

251
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:03,389
So my records show
that I paid it,

252
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:05,802
and I certainly don't
feel that we owe any late...

253
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:07,485
All right.

254
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,198
Well, I'll check
with the bank

255
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:12,020
and maybe the post office,

256
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:13,820
if they lost it or something.

257
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,903
Yeah, let me look
into that.

258
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:16,858
Okay.

259
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:18,454
Thank you.

260
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:29,790
Did you use
the MasterCard last month?

261
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:32,732
15.88 at Staples?

262
00:19:39,671 --> 00:19:41,582
We needed printer paper.

263
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:44,599
Walt, the MasterCard's
the one we don't use.

264
00:19:45,997 --> 00:19:46,833
Okay.

265
00:19:47,984 --> 00:19:50,485
So how was your day?

266
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:53,637
Oh, I don't know.

267
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:57,029
I don't know.
It was, um...

268
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,622
It was fine.

269
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,463
Come on. I'm shorthanded.
I need you to do some wipe-downs.

270
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:36,733
- Come on.
- What?

271
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:39,005
I said I need you outside
to do some wipe-downs.

272
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:41,414
Are you here to work
or to be staring at the skies?

273
00:20:41,422 --> 00:20:42,881
Come on, let's go.

274
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:46,122
Come on, man.

275
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:49,196
- Fuck you, Bogdan.
- What?

276
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:51,078
I said fuck you!

277
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:52,763
And your eyebrows!

278
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,135
Wipe down this!

279
00:21:58,209 --> 00:21:59,299
Uh, Hank.

280
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,441
Hank, it's Walt.
Hey.

281
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:04,160
Oh, listen...
I didn't wake you, did I?

282
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,041
Oh, good, good.

283
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:09,745
No, no, nothing's wrong.
I just, uh...

284
00:22:10,882 --> 00:22:13,595
I've been, uh, thinking
about that offer...

285
00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:15,964
that ride-along.

286
00:22:17,443 --> 00:22:19,627
It's the last house
on the right. See it?

287
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:21,453
Not the two-story one.
The one next to it.

288
00:22:21,476 --> 00:22:24,472
The kind of... I don't know,
what do you call that?

289
00:22:24,546 --> 00:22:26,289
- Green?
- Sage.

290
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:28,574
Sage.

291
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:31,232
What, do you work at
the fucking Pottery Barn?

292
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:33,318
Sage.
That's the word for it.

293
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:36,567
My fault the only word
your dumb ass knows is green?

294
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:37,811
Cheese dick.

295
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,984
I know that one.
How 'bout that?

296
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,863
Anyway, it's the sage one.
See it?

297
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,449
So what tells you
it's a meth lab?

298
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:48,271
Star snitch says
some dude

299
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:51,403
goes by Cap'n Cook
lives up to his name in there.

300
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,716
Says he always adds
a dash of chili powder.

301
00:22:55,892 --> 00:22:58,041
Ah, you exuberant
Mexicans.

302
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,047
Captain Cook,
that's a white boy's name.

303
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:02,494
Dopey as hell, too.

304
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:04,284
Yeah?
Tell you what.

305
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:07,167
I got 20 bucks that
says he's a beaner.

306
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,979
- All right.
- You're on.

307
00:23:11,219 --> 00:23:12,971
All right,
come on, come on.

308
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,076
All right. School bus is clear.
Got the green light.

309
00:23:20,116 --> 00:23:21,079
Copy that.

310
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,649
Watch this.
This makes 'em shit.

311
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,560
Go, go, go.

312
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:48,860
Meth labs are nasty
on a good day.

313
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:51,256
You mix that wrong,
you got mustard gas.

314
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:52,859
Phosphine gas.

315
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:55,188
I think.

316
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,504
Yeah, exactly.

317
00:23:56,612 --> 00:23:59,455
One whiff will kill you.
That's why the respirators.

318
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:49,131
House is clear.
One suspect in custody.

319
00:24:49,245 --> 00:24:50,462
Copy that.

320
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:53,944
The suspect, might he be
of the Latino persuasion?

321
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:56,735
Driver's license says
Emilio Koyama.

322
00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:58,136
Asian!

323
00:24:58,152 --> 00:24:59,391
Pay up, sucker.

324
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,329
First name Emilio.

325
00:25:01,451 --> 00:25:03,223
That's at least half
a beaner.

326
00:25:03,266 --> 00:25:05,281
Tell you what,
I'll let you off for a 10.

327
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,162
Cheer up, Gomey.
You people still got J. Lo.

328
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:13,811
Hank, do you think
I might get to go inside?

329
00:25:14,243 --> 00:25:15,669
See the actual lab?

330
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:21,500
Yeah. Yeah,
I tell you what,

331
00:25:21,505 --> 00:25:23,276
we're gonna go
peek our heads in,

332
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:24,924
check it out first.

333
00:25:25,551 --> 00:25:27,118
Stay here a minute.

334
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:58,754
God.

335
00:26:06,128 --> 00:26:07,240
Oh, my God.

336
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:10,403
Pinkman?

337
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:08,346
It's me.

338
00:27:08,595 --> 00:27:09,750
I'm alone.

339
00:27:16,223 --> 00:27:17,823
How'd you find me?

340
00:27:18,075 --> 00:27:20,444
You're still
in our filing system.

341
00:27:23,211 --> 00:27:25,987
So your aunt
owns this place, right?

342
00:27:26,702 --> 00:27:27,911
I own it.

343
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,065
No one's looking for you.

344
00:27:33,207 --> 00:27:34,677
Why are you here?

345
00:27:34,931 --> 00:27:36,752
I was curious.

346
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:39,311
Honestly,
I never expected you

347
00:27:39,314 --> 00:27:42,140
to amount to much,
but methamphetamine?

348
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,526
I didn't picture that.

349
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:50,023
There's a lot of money
in it, huh?

350
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,782
I don't know what
you're talking about.

351
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:53,614
- No?
- Not a clue.

352
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:56,765
Cap'n Cook?

353
00:27:57,873 --> 00:27:59,261
That's not you?

354
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:07,533
Like I said,
no one is looking for you.

355
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:11,374
Look, I don't know what you think
you're doing here, Mr. White.

356
00:28:11,677 --> 00:28:14,805
I mean, if you're planning
on giving me some bowl winder

357
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:17,758
about getting right with Jesus
by turning myself in...

358
00:28:17,768 --> 00:28:20,487
- Not really.
- High school was a long time ago.

359
00:28:20,594 --> 00:28:23,429
You ain't Welcome Back Kotter,
so step off.

360
00:28:23,544 --> 00:28:24,887
No speeches.

361
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:26,565
Short speech.

362
00:28:27,515 --> 00:28:30,305
You lost your partner today.
What's his name?

363
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:32,648
Emilio?

364
00:28:34,154 --> 00:28:36,154
Emilio is going to prison.

365
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:41,147
The DEA took all your money,
your lab.

366
00:28:42,832 --> 00:28:44,190
You got nothing.

367
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:45,697
Square 1.

368
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,885
But you know
the business.

369
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:51,865
And I know the chemistry.

370
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:56,811
I'm thinking...

371
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,814
maybe you and I
could partner up.

372
00:29:12,268 --> 00:29:14,529
You want to cook crystal meth?

373
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:16,837
You?

374
00:29:17,438 --> 00:29:19,990
You and, uh... and me?

375
00:29:20,957 --> 00:29:22,211
That's right.

376
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,634
Either that...

377
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,087
or I turn you in.

378
00:29:39,907 --> 00:29:41,236
What the hell is this?

379
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,556
Damned if I know.

380
00:29:42,663 --> 00:29:44,840
I described it
as mosaic folk art.

381
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:47,332
- Somebody bought it?
- Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis.

382
00:29:47,336 --> 00:29:48,883
$14.00 plus shipping.

383
00:29:48,906 --> 00:29:49,678
Yes!

384
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:52,997
At this rate, in 50 or 60 years,
you'll be rich.

385
00:29:54,006 --> 00:29:55,572
So how goes the novel?

386
00:29:55,597 --> 00:29:57,946
It's not a novel,
actually, which I have...

387
00:29:57,949 --> 00:30:00,651
You're not writing a novel?
You told me you were.

388
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:02,137
No. Short stories.

389
00:30:02,157 --> 00:30:04,772
I said that if eventually
I have enough good ones

390
00:30:04,774 --> 00:30:06,648
that maybe I'll try and...

391
00:30:07,977 --> 00:30:09,381
publish another collection.

392
00:30:09,403 --> 00:30:11,220
Those really didn't sell.

393
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:15,938
I just thought a novel
would be easier to sell.

394
00:30:16,056 --> 00:30:17,802
Yeah, well, maybe so.

395
00:30:19,787 --> 00:30:23,265
Ever want me to read anything,
I could critique it for you.

396
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:25,423
No.

397
00:30:27,174 --> 00:30:30,613
I mean, I'm not at
that stage where I...

398
00:30:32,094 --> 00:30:32,900
No.

399
00:30:33,436 --> 00:30:34,720
Open offer.

400
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:38,017
So what's up
with Walt lately?

401
00:30:38,018 --> 00:30:39,927
What do you mean?
He's fine.

402
00:30:40,065 --> 00:30:42,906
He just seems,
I don't know...

403
00:30:43,086 --> 00:30:44,644
quieter than usual.

404
00:30:44,986 --> 00:30:46,617
Turning 50
is a big deal.

405
00:30:46,842 --> 00:30:50,020
I mean, I'm sure as hell
not looking forward to 40.

406
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:54,393
You're gonna be
a complete basket case.

407
00:30:58,611 --> 00:30:59,883
So it's mid-life crisis.

408
00:30:59,894 --> 00:31:01,928
No, he's just quiet.

409
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:06,026
- How's the sex?
- Marie, Jesus.

410
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:08,096
Guess that answers that.

411
00:31:50,235 --> 00:31:52,222
You just gonna sit there?

412
00:31:59,716 --> 00:32:01,506
This.
Look at this.

413
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:04,289
Kjeldahl-style
recovery flask,

414
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:06,580
800 milliliters.
Very rare.

415
00:32:06,813 --> 00:32:08,753
You got your usual
paraphernalia:

416
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:11,051
Griffin beakers,
your Erlenmeyer flask.

417
00:32:11,087 --> 00:32:13,225
But the pi�ce de r�sistance:

418
00:32:13,762 --> 00:32:17,607
a round bottom boiling flask.
5,000 milliliters.

419
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:23,129
Well, I cook in one of those.

420
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,547
The big one.

421
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:26,833
One of these?

422
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:30,600
No, this is a volumetric flask.
You wouldn't cook in one of these.

423
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,349
Yeah, I do.

424
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:34,022
No, you don't.

425
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:37,890
A volumetric flask is
for general mixing and titration.

426
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:41,232
You wouldn't apply heat
to a volumetric flask.

427
00:32:41,262 --> 00:32:43,544
That's what
a boiling flask is for.

428
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:45,801
Did you learn nothing
from my chemistry class?

429
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,757
No. You flunked me.

430
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,931
- Remember?
- No wonder.

431
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:50,843
Prick.

432
00:32:51,328 --> 00:32:54,834
Now let me tell you something else.
This ain't chemistry,

433
00:32:54,968 --> 00:32:56,490
this is art.

434
00:32:57,246 --> 00:32:58,814
Cooking is art.

435
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:02,055
And the shit I cook is the bomb,
so don't be telling me.

436
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,246
The shit you cook is shit.

437
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,866
I saw your setup.
Ridiculous.

438
00:33:06,946 --> 00:33:09,432
You and I
will not make garbage.

439
00:33:09,768 --> 00:33:11,698
We will produce
a chemically pure

440
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:14,027
and stable product
that performs as advertised.

441
00:33:14,088 --> 00:33:16,635
No adulterants. No baby formula.
No chili powder.

442
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,763
No, no, chili P
is my signature.

443
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:20,032
Not anymore.

444
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,520
Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

445
00:33:24,498 --> 00:33:27,032
- What the hell is this?
- Lab safety equipment.

446
00:33:27,056 --> 00:33:30,190
We're also gonna have
an emergency eye wash station.

447
00:33:30,722 --> 00:33:33,541
These chemicals
and their fumes are toxic,

448
00:33:33,823 --> 00:33:35,251
in case you didn't know that.

449
00:33:35,274 --> 00:33:37,997
Well, you can dress up
like a faggot if you want.

450
00:33:38,045 --> 00:33:39,076
Not me.

451
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:47,708
Listen, this stuff doesn't
stay more than a day.

452
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:50,629
What? I thought
we were gonna cook here.

453
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:52,294
No, we're not
gonna cook here.

454
00:33:52,326 --> 00:33:55,131
Okay, this is my house.
I don't shit where I eat.

455
00:33:55,498 --> 00:33:57,288
Well, then, where
are we gonna work?

456
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:58,577
You tell me.

457
00:33:58,791 --> 00:33:59,964
This is your deal.

458
00:33:59,967 --> 00:34:02,808
You want to smoke it up,
smoke it up at your house.

459
00:34:02,921 --> 00:34:04,694
Nah, I didn't think so.

460
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:05,962
Oh, well.

461
00:34:07,788 --> 00:34:08,922
Well...

462
00:34:09,872 --> 00:34:13,184
what if we rented one
of those self-storage places,

463
00:34:13,203 --> 00:34:16,004
you know, those little orange garages,
worked out of there?

464
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:16,849
No.

465
00:34:17,314 --> 00:34:20,343
They're on to that.
They got dogs that sniff around.

466
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,418
RV. That's what you want.

467
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,312
What, like a Winnebago?

468
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:30,297
Yeah.

469
00:34:32,608 --> 00:34:34,802
I know a dude
who wants to sell his.

470
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:36,989
He just goes camping with it.

471
00:34:37,357 --> 00:34:39,070
But a mobile meth lab?

472
00:34:39,234 --> 00:34:41,010
That'd be the bomb.
I mean,

473
00:34:41,077 --> 00:34:43,107
drive way out
in the boonies.

474
00:34:43,771 --> 00:34:45,328
Be all evasive.

475
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,732
Dude, this isn't even 7 grand.
My guy wants 85.

476
00:35:15,737 --> 00:35:18,371
This is all the money
I have in the world.

477
00:35:19,195 --> 00:35:21,372
You're a drug dealer.
Negotiate.

478
00:35:23,101 --> 00:35:25,737
You are not how
I remember you from class,

479
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:27,376
I mean, like, not at all.

480
00:35:27,686 --> 00:35:30,242
- I gotta go.
- Wait, wait. Hold on.

481
00:35:31,415 --> 00:35:33,619
Tell me why
you're doing this.

482
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,054
Seriously.

483
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,683
Why do you do it?

484
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:38,713
Money, mainly.

485
00:35:40,276 --> 00:35:43,052
- There you go.
- Nah, come on!

486
00:35:43,364 --> 00:35:46,790
Man, some straight like you,
giant stick up his ass,

487
00:35:46,795 --> 00:35:48,540
all of a sudden
at age, what, 60,

488
00:35:48,544 --> 00:35:50,333
he's just gonna break bad?

489
00:35:50,467 --> 00:35:53,066
- I'm 50.
- It's weird is all, okay?

490
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:55,007
It doesn't compute.
Listen...

491
00:35:55,107 --> 00:35:57,888
if you've gone crazy
or something...

492
00:35:57,892 --> 00:36:00,611
I mean, if you've...
if you've gone crazy

493
00:36:00,903 --> 00:36:03,366
or depressed,
I'm just saying...

494
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:06,768
that's something
I need to know about.

495
00:36:07,094 --> 00:36:09,332
Okay?
I mean, that affects me.

496
00:36:14,777 --> 00:36:16,195
I am awake.

497
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:21,954
What?

498
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:27,204
Buy the RV.

499
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,386
We start tomorrow.

500
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:38,220
How's it coming
in there?

501
00:36:38,706 --> 00:36:39,796
Fine.

502
00:36:46,794 --> 00:36:48,764
Do you want me
or your dad?

503
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:51,986
Dad.

504
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:11,068
So how are those feeling in the waist?
Are they too tight?

505
00:37:11,069 --> 00:37:13,730
'Cause you don't want to get 'em
if they're too tight.

506
00:37:15,206 --> 00:37:16,937
They're pre-shrunk.

507
00:37:17,142 --> 00:37:19,784
Are you sure you don't want
to get a different kind.

508
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:21,805
Like, you know,
the skinny jeans?

509
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,827
Those are really supposed
to be in style now.

510
00:37:23,837 --> 00:37:25,167
The skaters wear them.

511
00:37:25,215 --> 00:37:26,894
Do I look like a skater?

512
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,341
All right.

513
00:37:28,866 --> 00:37:31,579
Mom, look at
my big-boy pants.

514
00:37:32,914 --> 00:37:36,034
Mommy, could you
zip up my big-boy pants?

515
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,031
- Don't.
- What?

516
00:37:45,454 --> 00:37:46,476
Don't.

517
00:37:46,629 --> 00:37:47,472
Walt.

518
00:37:50,257 --> 00:37:51,881
- Where...
- I have no idea.

519
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:55,986
You know what?
Don't even look at them.

520
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:58,129
They're obviously
very stupid.

521
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:00,155
Yep.

522
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,825
I think that, um...

523
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:05,778
I think those jeans
look really good on you.

524
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,388
You should get 'em
if you like 'em, okay?

525
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,353
Why don't you just hang out
here for a second?

526
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:11,806
I'll be right back.

527
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:12,750
Fine.

528
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:16,917
Mommy, I think I pinched a loaf
in my brand-new big-boy pants.

529
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:26,638
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong, chief?

530
00:38:26,657 --> 00:38:28,585
Having a little trouble
walking?

531
00:38:28,612 --> 00:38:30,604
Get off me.
Get off me!

532
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:35,597
I'll mess you up, man.

533
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,684
Well, you'll have one shot.
You better make it good.

534
00:38:38,895 --> 00:38:40,920
What, are you waiting
for your girlfriends?

535
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,521
You better go. Take it.

536
00:38:42,597 --> 00:38:44,253
Take your shot.
Take it!

537
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:47,295
Come on. Come on.

538
00:38:47,488 --> 00:38:49,868
- Come on, let's get outta here.
- Let's go.

539
00:38:51,825 --> 00:38:52,885
Psycho.

540
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,302
Yeah,
nothing but cows!

541
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:34,549
Got some big cow house
way out that way, like 2 miles,

542
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:36,679
but I don't see nobody.

543
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:38,753
Cow house?

544
00:39:39,342 --> 00:39:41,207
Yeah, where they live.

545
00:39:42,207 --> 00:39:43,416
The cows.

546
00:39:44,427 --> 00:39:45,778
Whatever, man.

547
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:47,930
Yeah, let's cook here.

548
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:51,792
Cow house.

549
00:39:52,928 --> 00:39:54,048
God help me.

550
00:40:06,054 --> 00:40:07,651
What are you doing?

551
00:40:07,743 --> 00:40:09,683
These are my good clothes.

552
00:40:10,803 --> 00:40:13,031
I can't go home smelling
like a meth lab.

553
00:40:13,597 --> 00:40:15,448
Yeah, you can.
I do.

554
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:17,920
Those?

555
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:22,186
Those, uh...
You're keeping those on, right?

556
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:31,070
Come on.

557
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:32,940
Daylight's burning.

558
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:34,325
Oh, my God.

559
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:45,008
Oh, this is, uh...
this is a good look for you.

560
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:48,834
And you're maybe only the world's
second biggest homo.

561
00:40:48,857 --> 00:40:51,057
Would you shut up
and help me?

562
00:40:51,747 --> 00:40:52,665
Oh, yeah.

563
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,802
Oh, yeah, work it.

564
00:40:55,103 --> 00:40:56,565
Baby, work it.

565
00:40:57,808 --> 00:40:59,002
Turn that off!

566
00:42:04,366 --> 00:42:05,950
This is glass grade.

567
00:42:07,396 --> 00:42:08,686
I mean, you got...

568
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:12,477
Jesus, you got crystals in here
2 inches, 3 inches long.

569
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,672
This is pure glass.

570
00:42:16,507 --> 00:42:18,134
You're a damn artist.

571
00:42:18,946 --> 00:42:21,334
This is art,
Mr. White.

572
00:42:22,226 --> 00:42:24,565
Actually, it's just
basic chemistry,

573
00:42:24,644 --> 00:42:26,963
but thank you, Jesse.
I'm glad it's acceptable.

574
00:42:27,157 --> 00:42:30,052
Acceptable?
You're the goddamn Iron Chef.

575
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:34,118
Every jibbhead from here to Timbuktu
is going to want a taste.

576
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,365
Now I gotta...
I gotta try this.

577
00:42:36,649 --> 00:42:38,283
No. No.

578
00:42:39,804 --> 00:42:42,352
No, we only sell it.
We don't use it.

579
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:44,906
Okay, since when?

580
00:42:45,883 --> 00:42:48,580
Listen, you've been watching
way too much Miami Vice.

581
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,339
That ain't happening.

582
00:42:53,695 --> 00:42:56,083
So... what now?

583
00:42:58,071 --> 00:42:59,722
How do we proceed?

584
00:43:03,678 --> 00:43:05,440
We cook more tomorrow.

585
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,164
Meantime...

586
00:43:09,149 --> 00:43:10,946
I know just the guy to talk to.

587
00:43:22,128 --> 00:43:24,176
Kraze, how you doing,
my man?

588
00:43:27,892 --> 00:43:30,319
You got a new dog.
Right on, man.

589
00:43:30,435 --> 00:43:31,829
What's his name?

590
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:35,493
Yeah, I had
a dog like that once,

591
00:43:35,494 --> 00:43:37,541
except maybe,
like, twice as big.

592
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,109
Super purebred.

593
00:43:39,412 --> 00:43:42,877
Now, me personally, I would train him
to go straight for the nuts...

594
00:43:42,898 --> 00:43:45,235
Just shut your mouth
and show me your money.

595
00:43:45,274 --> 00:43:47,009
I ain't buying, ese.

596
00:43:47,717 --> 00:43:49,016
I'm selling.

597
00:43:58,434 --> 00:44:00,733
Tell me that ain't
the finest scante

598
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:02,348
you ever laid eyes on.

599
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:04,596
Go ahead, try it.

600
00:44:05,445 --> 00:44:06,674
Hey, poochie.

601
00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:08,323
How you doing?

602
00:44:08,427 --> 00:44:10,560
Jesus Christ.

603
00:44:13,411 --> 00:44:14,944
See? What'd I say?

604
00:44:15,078 --> 00:44:17,800
- It's all right.
- It's all right? It's all right?

605
00:44:17,879 --> 00:44:20,329
- Yeah, it's all right.
- So, what? You back in business?

606
00:44:20,344 --> 00:44:21,926
Hell, yeah, I'm back.

607
00:44:22,511 --> 00:44:23,673
With a vengeance.

608
00:44:23,684 --> 00:44:25,797
Vato loco gotta make a living.

609
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,852
You know, with your cousin
gone away and all.

610
00:44:29,547 --> 00:44:32,085
And listen, homes,
about that.

611
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,994
It really broke me up
about Emilio.

612
00:44:36,895 --> 00:44:38,853
That dude
is like my brother.

613
00:44:39,196 --> 00:44:40,590
He okay?
You talk to him?

614
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:42,227
Yeah, yeah,
I talked to him.

615
00:44:42,256 --> 00:44:44,094
He said when the Feds came,
you were out

616
00:44:44,097 --> 00:44:46,321
sticking it
in some neighbor lady.

617
00:44:46,455 --> 00:44:48,821
Hey, you know,
I got lucky twice.

618
00:44:48,834 --> 00:44:50,448
I don't know, man.

619
00:44:50,913 --> 00:44:51,913
Emilio...

620
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,795
He thinks maybe
you dimed on him.

621
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:00,033
That is bullshit.

622
00:45:01,384 --> 00:45:03,429
That is bullshit,
Krazy-8!

623
00:45:03,593 --> 00:45:06,580
I should kick his punk ass
for even thinking that.

624
00:45:06,783 --> 00:45:09,437
You know what?
Next time you talk to Emilio,

625
00:45:09,496 --> 00:45:11,601
you tell him for me,
all right?

626
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:17,167
Why don't you
tell him yourself?

627
00:45:17,263 --> 00:45:19,660
- Made bail this morning.
- Go ahead, pendejo.

628
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,434
Kick my ass.

629
00:45:21,478 --> 00:45:22,925
Hey, listen...

630
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:28,035
Where did you get this?

631
00:45:29,909 --> 00:45:33,014
Because I know your little
punk ass didn't cook it.

632
00:46:01,398 --> 00:46:02,727
Hey, man.

633
00:46:03,313 --> 00:46:05,104
You some kind of nudist?

634
00:46:07,418 --> 00:46:10,707
That's some stone-fine tick tick
you been cooking there, ese.

635
00:46:10,772 --> 00:46:12,874
How about you come
work for me?

636
00:46:14,246 --> 00:46:16,603
I'd be willing
to sell it to you if...

637
00:46:17,353 --> 00:46:18,860
the price is right.

638
00:46:29,595 --> 00:46:31,983
You out here
all by yourself, huh?

639
00:46:40,494 --> 00:46:42,046
I know you.

640
00:46:42,058 --> 00:46:44,752
He was there when I got busted.
He's with the DEA!

641
00:46:44,865 --> 00:46:45,698
No.

642
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:47,949
You ratasnitch
motherfucker!

643
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,602
Run, Mr. White! Run!

644
00:47:00,499 --> 00:47:02,245
I say we cap 'em both.

645
00:47:09,453 --> 00:47:11,782
Hey, you really
cook up that batch?

646
00:47:13,442 --> 00:47:14,218
Yeah.

647
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:15,621
You an artist.

648
00:47:17,783 --> 00:47:19,211
It's a damn shame.

649
00:47:19,245 --> 00:47:21,537
Wait! Wait a minute.

650
00:47:22,846 --> 00:47:24,085
Listen to me.

651
00:47:24,831 --> 00:47:26,592
I'll teach you my recipe.

652
00:47:27,586 --> 00:47:30,298
What do you say?
You want to cook like me?

653
00:47:33,034 --> 00:47:34,826
You let us both live...

654
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,736
and I will teach you.

655
00:48:09,046 --> 00:48:10,620
Put the cigarette out.

656
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:14,739
Please.

657
00:48:58,081 --> 00:48:59,456
Move it, homes.

658
00:48:59,722 --> 00:49:01,384
We ain't got all day.

659
00:49:04,112 --> 00:49:05,037
Okay.

660
00:53:16,204 --> 00:53:17,532
What happened?

661
00:53:21,587 --> 00:53:23,378
What'd you
do to them?

662
00:53:24,927 --> 00:53:27,204
Red phosphorus
in the presence of moisture

663
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:30,743
and accelerated by heat
yields phosphorus hydride.

664
00:53:32,387 --> 00:53:33,760
Phosphine gas.

665
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,286
One good whiff and...

666
00:54:01,436 --> 00:54:02,637
We gotta...

667
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,619
We gotta... clean this up.

668
00:54:55,785 --> 00:54:57,232
Where were you?

669
00:55:05,868 --> 00:55:06,737
Walt.

670
00:55:10,144 --> 00:55:13,095
I don't know what's been going on
with you lately, but...

671
00:55:13,096 --> 00:55:15,443
Nothing.
I'm fine.

672
00:55:15,658 --> 00:55:17,285
Whatever it is...

673
00:55:18,058 --> 00:55:19,674
I'll tell you this.

674
00:55:20,512 --> 00:55:23,446
I do not like it
when you don't talk to me.

675
00:55:25,064 --> 00:55:27,800
The worst thing
you can do is shut me out.

676
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:21,963
Walter, is that you?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
