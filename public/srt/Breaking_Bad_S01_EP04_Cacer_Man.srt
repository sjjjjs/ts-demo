1
00:00:02,578 --> 00:00:03,914
Operation...

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,770
Icebreaker.

3
00:00:08,594 --> 00:00:11,335
How we liking that?
We never used that before, did we?

4
00:00:11,392 --> 00:00:13,419
- Isn't it the name of a breath mint?
- What?

5
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:15,231
"Icebreakers", right? Breath mint?

6
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:16,829
Nobody's gonna be
thinking that.

7
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:19,651
They'll think about a big ass ship
in the North Pole, breaking ice.

8
00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:23,004
Says you. I'm gonna be thinking
"Operation Breath Mint."

9
00:00:23,146 --> 00:00:26,801
I'm thinking "Operation Breath Mint"
every time we're on a stakeout together.

10
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:29,739
Your breath could knock
a buzzard off a shit wagon.

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,116
All right.

12
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:34,125
"Operation TBD."

13
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:36,149
Thanks for nothing, Gomie.

14
00:00:36,212 --> 00:00:38,005
Anyway.
Say hello to...

15
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:41,589
Domingo Gallardo Molina,
AKA "Krazy 8."

16
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:45,989
Smarter than your average cheese-eater.
I turned him out at the street-level,

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,963
but this dude's like
the Jeffersons: movin' on up.

18
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:52,287
Every small-time dealers he'd throw at
us, he'd end up snaking their customers.

19
00:00:52,288 --> 00:00:54,885
It turns out he's missing,
presumed dead.

20
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,228
Found his car
out in the boonies.

21
00:00:57,347 --> 00:01:01,318
Last guy he ratted out
was none other than his cousin,

22
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,629
Emilio Koyama.

23
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:06,032
You thinking the cousin
found out and took revenge?

24
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:08,638
Could be.
Turns out he's missing, too.

25
00:01:08,863 --> 00:01:11,980
Normally, I'd say someone
did the world a favor.

26
00:01:12,737 --> 00:01:14,401
But our snitch's car?

27
00:01:14,592 --> 00:01:18,066
Turns out we find two grams of meth
in it, we take it to the lab.

28
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:21,566
They come back, they tell us it is
the purest they have ever seen.

29
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:23,145
99.1%.

30
00:01:23,315 --> 00:01:26,524
Our chemist was blown away. He said
he couldn't do the same thing better.

31
00:01:26,558 --> 00:01:29,544
Worse yet, it didn't come out of
some superlab in Mexico.

32
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:32,603
We're thinking this was cooked
right here, in the Land of Enchantment.

33
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:36,354
Car was abandoned at
what appears to be a cook site.

34
00:01:36,637 --> 00:01:39,312
This is the only other
thing left behind.

35
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:42,722
We're sending it off to Quantico,
see if they can pull something off it.

36
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:47,008
Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter
element and found the same 99.1 meth.

37
00:01:49,344 --> 00:01:50,816
So be on notice.

38
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:53,737
We got new players in town.

39
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:58,118
We don't know who they are,
where they come from...

40
00:01:58,592 --> 00:02:01,388
but they possess an
extremely high skill-set.

41
00:02:01,594 --> 00:02:03,046
Me personally?

42
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:07,703
I'm thinking Albuquerque just
might have a new kingpin.

43

45
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,467
Jesus. Walt, you're burning
the shit out of them.

46
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:47,093
Damn it.

47
00:02:47,503 --> 00:02:50,011
Hey, Sky, you got
any more chicken?

48
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:52,849
Emeril here is gonna
need a fresh pack.

49
00:02:54,177 --> 00:02:55,657
All right,
looking good.

50
00:02:55,749 --> 00:02:58,497
Is this low-fat mayonnaise
in the cole slaw?

51
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,609
I don't know.
It's store-bought.

52
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:04,937
Hank, you need
another beer?

53
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:06,857
Does the Pope shit in his hat?

54
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,752
I don't think
that he does, Hank.

55
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:11,949
And I think everybody would like it
if you'd stop saying that.

56
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:14,904
- Marie, some more wine, maybe?
- I'm all right, thanks.

57
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,451
Hey, I want a beer.

58
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:19,634
Yeah. I want Shania Twain
to give me a tuggie.

59
00:03:19,836 --> 00:03:21,953
Guess what?
That ain't happening, either.

60
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,276
- How about some more soda?
- Yeah, sure.

61
00:03:24,322 --> 00:03:26,278
Honey, do you need anything?

62
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:29,460
- No, Walt. Thank you.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

63
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,484
What, are you kidding me?

64
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,945
You look like
a damn movie star, man.

65
00:03:55,071 --> 00:03:57,739
Girls gotta be lining up
left and right.

66
00:03:58,193 --> 00:04:00,701
- Tell him how good-looking he is.
- He's adorable.

67
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,343
He don't wanna be friggin' adorable.
He wants to be hot.

68
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:06,259
You see what I'm talking about?
That's a female perspective.

69
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:07,822
She supposed to say that.

70
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:10,653
Look, a guy doesn't have
to look like, uh...

71
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:13,795
Charlton Heston...
I'm talking "Moses" days...

72
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:15,889
to get a girl,
all right?

73
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:17,686
You just gotta have...

74
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:19,760
confidence.

75
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:23,046
Confidence and...
and persistence.

76
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,423
That's what I'm talking about.

77
00:04:25,562 --> 00:04:28,243
I chased your Aunt Marie here
all over creation.

78
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:31,398
I kept bugging her for a date.
She kept saying no.

79
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:33,173
What, did I ask you
like 50 times?

80
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:36,310
It was before
they tightened the stalking laws.

81
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:39,863
Anyway, how about your dad here?

82
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,107
Right there's a good story, Walt.

83
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:43,655
Tell him how you met Skyler.

84
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:46,722
Mom was a waitress
in Los Alamos.

85
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,955
And Dad said
that thing to you...

86
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,741
Actually, your mother
wasn't a waitress.

87
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:56,044
It was a summer job,

88
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:58,690
and she was the hostess,

89
00:04:58,695 --> 00:05:01,205
and she also worked
the cash register.

90
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:03,489
And I used to go
in there a lot

91
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:07,372
because it was close enough to the lab
where I could ride my bicycle.

92
00:05:09,206 --> 00:05:11,057
And once I noticed her...

93
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:14,391
it got to be so that
I would only go in

94
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,393
when I knew she was working.

95
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:19,876
When it was slow,
she would lean against the counter,

96
00:05:20,263 --> 00:05:22,349
doing her crossword puzzles,

97
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:24,688
but kind of hiding it, right,

98
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:27,121
pretending that
she was still working.

99
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:29,327
And once I caught on to that,

100
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:33,205
I would do crossword puzzles
while I ate my grilled cheese sandwich.

101
00:05:33,278 --> 00:05:35,646
It got so that
everyday at lunch,

102
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:39,597
we would both be doing
the New York Times crossword puzzle

103
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,685
ten feet from each other.

104
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:46,815
Eventually,

105
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:49,858
I caught her
looking over at me.

106
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:54,467
So, I began saying,
"Excuse me.

107
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:59,490
"Fourteen across, seven-letter word
for whatchamacallit.

108
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,183
"May I ask what
you wrote down?"

109
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:06,946
That got us talking.

110
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:11,027
Boy, I tell you, I was...
I was terrible at those puzzles.

111
00:06:12,276 --> 00:06:15,440
I don't think that I finished
even one of them.

112
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,486
But your mother
would do them in ink.

113
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:20,692
Very smooth.

114
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:24,563
I'll bet you didn't think
your old man had it in him?

115
00:06:24,565 --> 00:06:26,909
But that's what I'm talking about.
That's persistence.

116
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,049
You see? Once you set
your cap for something,

117
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,982
or somebody,
you gotta just, you know...

118
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:36,998
Skyler?

119
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:39,513
Mom, are you all right?

120
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:43,594
Shh, honey. It's okay.

121
00:06:44,393 --> 00:06:45,854
What's the matter?

122
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:50,726
What is it?

123
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,552
Ask him.

124
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:05,945
What's she talking about?

125
00:07:10,956 --> 00:07:11,887
Walt.

126
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:21,022
I have cancer.

127
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:27,578
Lung cancer.

128
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:38,893
It's bad.

129
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:03,087
Ask him how long he's known.

130
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:06,644
I guess a month,
maybe, or...

131
00:08:06,808 --> 00:08:08,502
For God sakes, Walt.

132
00:08:08,517 --> 00:08:11,578
We're just sitting out there having
a cookout like nothing's going on?

133
00:08:11,636 --> 00:08:14,315
He made me promise
not to tell anybody.

134
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:17,226
Christ, these last 48 hours.

135
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:20,161
And it's the weekend,

136
00:08:20,423 --> 00:08:22,972
so I couldn't even get
his doctor on the phone.

137
00:08:23,117 --> 00:08:26,771
Buddy, why... I mean,
why wouldn't you want to tell anybody?

138
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:29,081
Don't you see?

139
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:31,783
Everybody just wants
to help you.

140
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:33,765
We're family.

141
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:36,481
We get through
these things together.

142
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:38,526
I mean, I don't get...
You know...

143
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:40,241
Lung cancer?

144
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,675
How could that happen?
You don't smoke.

145
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:44,985
I'm thinking that
this goes back

146
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:47,484
20 years maybe
to the applications lab.

147
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,894
All those chemicals
they had you working around?

148
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:52,118
We always took
the proper precautions.

149
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:55,980
One time you complained they didn't
give you the right kind of...

150
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,305
I don't know, some kind
of ventilation hood or something.

151
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:02,164
- And then the headaches.
- Honey, it wasn't that.

152
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:05,023
How do they think they
can get away with this?

153
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:07,063
We should hire a lawyer.

154
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:09,983
First, let's deal with this.

155
00:09:11,137 --> 00:09:14,431
Okay? So what's
the next step for Walt?

156
00:09:15,327 --> 00:09:17,870
Certainly a second
opinion, right?

157
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:19,256
Right.

158
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:20,976
Right. Absolutely.

159
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:23,193
Okay. So first thing
tomorrow,

160
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:25,631
I talk to my radiologists,

161
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:28,588
we find you the best...

162
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,778
the oncology dream team.

163
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:51,498
I wanna go check
on Walt Jr.

164
00:09:52,794 --> 00:09:54,315
I'm gonna see...

165
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,189
if I can talk him into,
I don't know, joining us.

166
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:02,162
I really didn't mean for him
to find out that way.

167
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:13,872
Whatever happens...

168
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,164
I hope this goes
without saying, but...

169
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:19,943
whatever happens...

170
00:10:21,227 --> 00:10:23,477
I want you to know that...

171
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:27,446
I'll always take care
of your family.

172
00:10:55,257 --> 00:10:57,593
Yo, check out
these fake Pop Tarts.

173
00:10:57,876 --> 00:10:59,260
These are mad tight.

174
00:10:59,314 --> 00:11:01,989
- No, thanks, man. Pass.
- Your loss.

175
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:04,870
These are from Canada
or something. Imported.

176
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:07,214
Yo, what happened
to your hallway, man?

177
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,076
- Did the ceiling fall down or...
- Oh, yeah...

178
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,975
I think the house
is just settling.

179
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:16,872
It's been caving in
left and right.

180
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:18,634
Hit me in the eye.

181
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:20,204
It's bananas.

182
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:23,982
Yo, my pops could fix you up.
He's like a contractor or something.

183
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:27,060
Right on.
I should grab that number.

184
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:30,140
Say, Jesse.
You still cook a little crystal?

185
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:35,313
Could be, yeah.

186
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:37,507
You know,
from time to time.

187
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,965
I heard you lost
your partner.

188
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:41,806
Emilio.

189
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:46,446
- Didn't he get locked up?
- No, man. He's out.

190
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,786
His cousin bailed him out.
He skipped town or something.

191
00:11:49,857 --> 00:11:51,967
I don't know about
any of that.

192
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:54,596
I've been kinda doing
my own thing these days.

193
00:11:54,784 --> 00:11:57,350
But you maybe got
some crystal, man?

194
00:11:57,682 --> 00:12:01,467
'Cause I could seriously go for a bowl.
You know? Take the edge off.

195
00:12:01,516 --> 00:12:04,497
Hell, yeah.
Sunday night bowl, yo.

196
00:12:09,956 --> 00:12:12,397
Maybe it just
so happens that...

197
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:15,914
I just recently cooked
the best batch ever.

198
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:21,955
Oh, yeah. Came up with
this whole new recipe.

199
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,989
It's more like a formula.

200
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:27,794
It's like way,
way more chemically...

201
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:31,146
You know, it's just the bomb.

202
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:34,467
But, you know, I don't know,

203
00:12:34,468 --> 00:12:37,840
I've been thinking lately
I'll just lay off of it for a while.

204
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,088
'Cause lately it's been
making me paranoid, so...

205
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:49,154
You know, for, like...
like healthwise, just lay off.

206
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,432
Yo, if you're not
into sharing, man,

207
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,569
just tell us to piss off.
It's cool.

208
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:55,266
We don't need no soap opera.

209
00:12:55,323 --> 00:12:56,669
Yeah, man.
Whatever.

210
00:12:56,715 --> 00:12:58,451
No, no.
It's all good.

211
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:00,483
You know, I...
I'm just saying...

212
00:13:00,957 --> 00:13:03,050
Hey, I got...
I got plenty of pot.

213
00:13:03,223 --> 00:13:05,362
Yeah, I think
I'll bounce, man.

214
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,270
Yeah, sounds about right.

215
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:09,074
Hey, yo, yo.

216
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:10,431
Hey, homes.

217
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:11,875
I'm joking.

218
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:14,669
Okay, I'm totally
joking with you.

219
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:17,461
You kidding?
Sit down.

220
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:26,702
Best scante ever.

221
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:28,514
Grab that pipe.

222
00:16:43,141 --> 00:16:44,923
Do you need
some help?

223
00:16:47,326 --> 00:16:49,060
No, I'm fine, honey.

224
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:51,098
I'm fine. Just...

225
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,850
Privacy.

226
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:54,189
Thanks.

227
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,148
I'm right outside
if you need me.

228
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,831
Yeah, anytime on Friday
is absolutely fine.

229
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:13,357
Thank you so much
for working us in.

230
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,335
Can I just put that
on a credit card?

231
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:19,850
Great.

232
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:20,941
Perfect.

233
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:23,471
Okay, so we will see you

234
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:25,922
at 10:45 on Friday morning.

235
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,502
Thank you so much.

236
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:35,923
Honey.

237
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,287
The best oncologist...

238
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,261
I mean, not even
just in New Mexico,

239
00:17:40,263 --> 00:17:43,311
but one of the top ten
in the entire nation...

240
00:17:43,534 --> 00:17:46,495
His name is Dr. Delcavoli.

241
00:17:46,952 --> 00:17:48,804
And we see him on Friday.

242
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:54,328
I mean, Marie really
came through for us.

243
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:56,478
She had her boss call and...

244
00:18:01,245 --> 00:18:02,558
This is good.

245
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:05,528
From here on out,
things are gonna...

246
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,988
What's that
we're putting on a credit card?

247
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,806
It's just a deposit
kind of thing.

248
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:14,839
- How much of a deposit?
- It's $5,000.

249
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,452
Five thousand?

250
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,791
And what's that?
Just to start?

251
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,085
Just to tell me
what I already know?

252
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:32,091
Walt, he's not
in our HMO, okay?

253
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:34,465
So be it.
We'll figure it out.

254
00:18:36,442 --> 00:18:39,534
Come on. Don't get hung up
on money here.

255
00:18:39,972 --> 00:18:41,945
We can always borrow
from Hank.

256
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:43,518
Absolutely not.

257
00:18:46,482 --> 00:18:47,637
No, I just...

258
00:18:48,012 --> 00:18:49,692
We're not gonna do that.

259
00:18:50,408 --> 00:18:52,713
Well, maybe we
can ask your mom.

260
00:18:55,037 --> 00:18:57,170
Have you even
called her yet?

261
00:19:00,296 --> 00:19:02,817
Regardless,
you're gonna have to tell her.

262
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:05,213
- I'm willing to do it...
- I'll call.

263
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:12,156
I don't want us
thinking about money.

264
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:16,500
Money is not the issue here.
It's not.

265
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:28,072
I'll take care of the deposit.

266
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:36,503
I'll borrow it
from my pension.

267
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,906
What's up?

268
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:20,859
I thought I heard mice.

269
00:20:22,082 --> 00:20:23,904
That's all we need, huh?

270
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,431
So, what's up, pal?

271
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:29,821
What the hell's
wrong with you?

272
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:34,145
What?

273
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,285
You're acting all...

274
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,176
Why are you acting so...

275
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:44,885
weird?

276
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:49,221
You're acting like
nothing is going on.

277
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:42,983
Come on!

278
00:22:43,897 --> 00:22:47,014
Am I gonna have to come down
there and whip your ass?

279
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:03,597
And let me tell you something else.
I'm not doing this for charity, right?

280
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:06,317
I'm the best he's got in that office.
He knows it, I know it.

281
00:23:06,322 --> 00:23:09,020
I expect to be paid
to a level comens...

282
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:13,273
I said, "Dave, do you think
40 grand is a proper bonus?"

283
00:23:13,514 --> 00:23:16,474
That's less than 10% of what
I booked for you guys this quarter.

284
00:23:16,476 --> 00:23:18,864
I'm not going to sit here
and be disrespected.

285
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:20,974
Oh, he's shitin bricks.

286
00:23:21,207 --> 00:23:22,606
Oh, you know he is.

287
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:25,137
Yeah, that man lives in fear.
I'll go across town.

288
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:26,780
Hell, I could go anywhere.

289
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:30,328
Hoffman-Gordon-Bradley or Sorcher,
even Goldberg-Wayne.

290
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:33,051
They'd make me a partner
just for walking in the damn door.

291
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:35,050
That's how ecstatic
they'd be.

292
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,371
Hells, yes, brother-man!

293
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:40,470
Check this chick out.

294
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:42,975
Who?

295
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:46,013
Buddy, she's a cow.

296
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,185
Stacey's a cow.

297
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:51,280
We're talking major
barnyard boo-hog.

298
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:55,545
Roll her in flour and look for the wet
spot before you hit that, man. You know?

299
00:23:58,959 --> 00:23:59,820
Sir?

300
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:02,557
Sir?

301
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,900
Sorry. Hi.

302
00:24:07,923 --> 00:24:09,832
- What can I do for you?
- Which dude?

303
00:24:09,892 --> 00:24:11,977
The dude that looked
like a lizard?

304
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,324
I'm sorry.

305
00:24:15,796 --> 00:24:19,686
I would like a cashier's check
in the full amount

306
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,941
made out to Oncology Partners
of New Mexico, please.

307
00:24:25,184 --> 00:24:29,114
Oh, that's O-N-C-O-L-O-G-Y.

308
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,553
Yeah, you got it.

309
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:35,919
I don't understand
why they're forcing you

310
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:38,162
to choose between
the piccolo and the oboe.

311
00:24:38,201 --> 00:24:40,435
You show so much
promise with both.

312
00:24:40,494 --> 00:24:42,674
They can't have
any switching between woodwinds

313
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,257
because no matter how divided up,
someone would be left out.

314
00:24:45,265 --> 00:24:47,073
Well, rules are rules, I guess.

315
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:49,205
Sure, rules and rules.
I'm all for that.

316
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:52,587
But I'm telling you,
you really shine on that oboe.

317
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,176
You have real talent,
and I'm not just saying that.

318
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:56,323
Thanks.

319
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:01,123
What about Mr. Pemberton? Is he
giving you enough individual attention?

320
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,409
I'd have to say so.

321
00:25:02,443 --> 00:25:05,765
He tries to talk to each one of us
at least once during every practice.

322
00:25:05,768 --> 00:25:07,857
That's good.
Feedback's important.

323
00:25:07,895 --> 00:25:09,604
It's key, I think.

324
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,987
Hey, so how was
soccer practice?

325
00:25:17,074 --> 00:25:19,511
I think that
was in our backyard.

326
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:28,868
Who's there?

327
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:38,165
What the hell are you
doing out here?

328
00:25:41,252 --> 00:25:42,435
Hey, Dad.

329
00:25:44,014 --> 00:25:45,256
Hey, Mom.

330
00:25:47,525 --> 00:25:49,728
You got new patio furniture.

331
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,274
Right on!

332
00:25:56,085 --> 00:25:57,186
My leg.

333
00:27:00,718 --> 00:27:02,938
What do you think
it could be?

334
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,423
God knows
I'm no expert.

335
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:08,934
I don't know.
Uppers, downers?

336
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:10,612
Your guess
is as good as mine.

337
00:27:10,624 --> 00:27:13,688
I think we should check
his arms for needle marks.

338
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:19,322
Do we let him stay?

339
00:27:19,993 --> 00:27:22,875
The Presbyterian Church
has those meetings.

340
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:25,238
So maybe on condition,
you know?

341
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,197
If he agrees to attend?

342
00:27:28,152 --> 00:27:30,660
I just don't know
what to tell Jake.

343
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:41,284
Good evening.

344
00:27:42,551 --> 00:27:44,122
Well, sleep well?

345
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:47,982
What time's, uh...
What time is dinner?

346
00:27:49,716 --> 00:27:51,127
In about an hour.

347
00:27:55,034 --> 00:27:58,062
You know, I could wash
those clothes if you'd like.

348
00:27:58,189 --> 00:28:00,200
They look a little lived in.

349
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:02,661
No, that's cool.

350
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:04,380
Maybe later.

351
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:11,392
We are not doing this again.

352
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,790
- Adam...
- No.

353
00:28:13,287 --> 00:28:16,534
We said we'd lay down the law,
we lay down the law.

354
00:28:16,576 --> 00:28:19,161
We just have to be
consistent about it.

355
00:29:09,699 --> 00:29:11,555
You're not taking the bus?

356
00:29:15,244 --> 00:29:17,083
All right, well, listen.

357
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:21,366
Give me maybe another 20 minutes
and we'll get out of here.

358
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,670
All right.

359
00:29:25,356 --> 00:29:26,481
Yeah, good.

360
00:29:57,802 --> 00:30:01,341
You know,
I just think that...

361
00:30:04,515 --> 00:30:07,630
things have a way
of working themselves out.

362
00:30:32,753 --> 00:30:34,614
When did you get this?

363
00:30:35,025 --> 00:30:37,343
Last May at
the year-end assembly.

364
00:30:37,453 --> 00:30:40,429
They gave me that one, too.
The one on the end.

365
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:44,859
Environmental
Consciousness Award.

366
00:30:45,546 --> 00:30:49,095
What's that mean?
You, like, recycle cans and shit?

367
00:30:49,697 --> 00:30:52,393
I contacted the Albuquerque Journal
and asked what chemicals

368
00:30:52,395 --> 00:30:55,842
they use to bleach their paper. They
wound up writing an article about it.

369
00:30:55,914 --> 00:30:57,648
Right on, little bro!

370
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,860
Making mad in-roads
with the business community.

371
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,141
All right!

372
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,236
Now, hey, remember,

373
00:31:04,618 --> 00:31:07,768
not all learning
comes out of books.

374
00:31:12,092 --> 00:31:13,311
Look at you.

375
00:31:14,546 --> 00:31:16,935
We should hang out more often.

376
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:18,801
You know, just...

377
00:31:19,113 --> 00:31:21,081
just kick back and chill.

378
00:31:21,668 --> 00:31:23,254
I mean, if you ever,

379
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,856
like, I don't know,
need advice.

380
00:31:27,142 --> 00:31:30,621
Because, yo, I mean,
I've been through it all. For real.

381
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:35,593
Hey, man, you...

382
00:31:36,132 --> 00:31:37,820
You play the flute?

383
00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:40,063
It's a piccolo, actually.

384
00:31:40,074 --> 00:31:42,807
Dude, play some...
play some Jethro Tull.

385
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:46,727
Hey, guys.

386
00:31:46,735 --> 00:31:48,400
How we doing in here?

387
00:31:49,105 --> 00:31:50,207
We're good.

388
00:31:54,354 --> 00:31:55,637
Yeah. Fine, Mom.

389
00:31:55,775 --> 00:31:57,430
Well, that's good.

390
00:31:57,864 --> 00:31:59,487
That's... That's great.

391
00:32:08,148 --> 00:32:09,296
What the hell?

392
00:32:09,893 --> 00:32:11,159
You see this?

393
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,805
What, am I some criminal
or something?

394
00:32:15,215 --> 00:32:17,098
- Whatever.
- Whatever?

395
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:20,207
What, you think that's okay?

396
00:32:20,582 --> 00:32:22,856
Like, "Oh, we can't
let that scumbag

397
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,459
"warp the mind of
our favorite son."

398
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:27,848
I'm the favorite?

399
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,147
Yeah, right.

400
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:33,828
You're practically
all they ever talk about.

401
00:34:10,835 --> 00:34:12,217
Oh, snap.

402
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:15,686
Awesome.

403
00:34:50,593 --> 00:34:51,961
Yo, man, it's me.

404
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:54,950
Hey, listen.
You know, that product?

405
00:34:56,063 --> 00:34:57,774
You got any more of that?

406
00:34:57,933 --> 00:35:00,318
Nah, man, okay?
I'm done giving out freebies.

407
00:35:00,322 --> 00:35:02,716
You want charity,
go ask the Salvation Army.

408
00:35:02,777 --> 00:35:04,295
No, no charity.

409
00:35:04,627 --> 00:35:07,211
I got this cousin,
he's got him some rich friends.

410
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,081
These dudes are in town.
They're looking to par-tay.

411
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:13,214
And your stuff is,
like, so sweet.

412
00:35:13,674 --> 00:35:15,270
So what do you say?

413
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,376
You up for making
some fat stacks?

414
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,028
Because they'll buy
everything you got.

415
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:42,055
You can't be serious.

416
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:45,382
What the hell
are you doing here?

417
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:47,486
Yo, I waited till
the bowl buster left.

418
00:35:47,543 --> 00:35:49,512
I mean, no offense.

419
00:35:52,029 --> 00:35:53,232
Who sent you?

420
00:35:54,243 --> 00:35:56,745
You wearing a wire?
You setting me up?

421
00:35:57,966 --> 00:35:59,591
A wire?
You want a wire?

422
00:35:59,651 --> 00:36:02,239
I got a wire.
Speak into the mic, bitch!

423
00:36:02,524 --> 00:36:05,183
What the hell's wrong
with you? A wire.

424
00:36:09,218 --> 00:36:11,076
So who did you tell about...

425
00:36:11,218 --> 00:36:14,660
- Nobody. What are you, nuts?
- Then why are you here?

426
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:18,129
I don't know.

427
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:19,831
To, like...

428
00:36:20,294 --> 00:36:21,621
touch base.

429
00:36:22,535 --> 00:36:23,829
Touch base?

430
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,396
Yeah, you know...

431
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:28,487
what you call...

432
00:36:29,183 --> 00:36:30,430
a debrief?

433
00:36:30,951 --> 00:36:32,667
Maybe we could, like...

434
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:34,888
I thought we could debrief.

435
00:36:34,991 --> 00:36:36,180
Debrief?

436
00:36:37,152 --> 00:36:38,308
Wow, that's...

437
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:41,657
that's what you think we need,
to debrief?

438
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:48,028
Yeah, after what happened,
it just seems like the thing to do.

439
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:50,558
Kind of, you know,
talk about it.

440
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,371
We can't talk to anybody else.

441
00:36:55,001 --> 00:36:57,644
Anyway, that,
and I wanted to...

442
00:36:57,995 --> 00:37:01,113
I wanted to tell you
how much everybody digs

443
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:03,597
that meth we cooked.

444
00:37:03,726 --> 00:37:05,557
Everybody digs the meth...

445
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:07,328
we cooked.

446
00:37:08,544 --> 00:37:10,084
Seriously, I got...

447
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,767
dudes that would give
their left nut for a little more.

448
00:37:14,785 --> 00:37:15,648
Great.

449
00:37:15,653 --> 00:37:17,924
I'm just saying, if you ever...

450
00:37:18,858 --> 00:37:21,889
saw your way clear to...

451
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,511
You know, you and I...

452
00:37:25,336 --> 00:37:27,117
cooking a little more.

453
00:37:35,935 --> 00:37:37,715
Get the hell off my property.

454
00:37:37,737 --> 00:37:40,986
- What? I'm just saying.
- Go and don't come back.

455
00:37:41,298 --> 00:37:42,282
Now!

456
00:37:44,775 --> 00:37:45,793
All right.

457
00:37:46,937 --> 00:37:48,229
You know what?

458
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,311
Four grand.

459
00:37:51,779 --> 00:37:55,091
Your share
from selling that batch.

460
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,631
That's why I'm here.

461
00:37:58,633 --> 00:38:00,203
Yeah, that's right.

462
00:38:00,649 --> 00:38:02,329
I didn't smoke it all.

463
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:28,083
Non-small cell adenocarcinoma.

464
00:38:28,401 --> 00:38:29,770
Stage 3a,

465
00:38:29,778 --> 00:38:33,077
which means it's spread
from the lung to the lymph nodes.

466
00:38:33,168 --> 00:38:35,647
There's no denying
it's very serious.

467
00:38:36,436 --> 00:38:37,758
But is it...

468
00:38:39,218 --> 00:38:40,452
It is...

469
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:42,947
curable?

470
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:45,985
I prefer the word "treatable."

471
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:50,343
But the treatments we have at our
disposal can be very effective.

472
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:52,548
Without making any promises,
I can tell you that

473
00:38:52,551 --> 00:38:55,952
the specific course of radiation
and chemotherapy I'm going to suggest

474
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,653
has been successful.

475
00:38:57,678 --> 00:39:01,617
In certain cases, it prolonged patients'
lives and even resulted in remission.

476
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:06,434
What about
the side effects?

477
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:10,369
Well, they can be mild
to practically non-existent,

478
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:12,500
or they can be
pretty darn awful.

479
00:39:12,515 --> 00:39:14,319
It varies from patient to patient.

480
00:39:14,342 --> 00:39:16,243
Typically, there's hair loss,

481
00:39:16,307 --> 00:39:20,145
which begins a couple of weeks
after the start of chemotherapy.

482
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,779
You may find yourself unusually
fatigued, not much energy.

483
00:39:23,808 --> 00:39:25,670
You won't want
to get out of bed.

484
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:29,569
You may lose weight due to reduced
appetite and certain intestinal issues.

485
00:39:29,884 --> 00:39:33,273
Muscle aches and pains,
gums get sore and bleed.

486
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:37,083
And, of course,
there's the possibility of nausea.

487
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:41,185
Although, we'll prescribe an anti-emetic
and try to counteract that.

488
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,158
Possible kidney
or bladder irritation.

489
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:45,956
You may wind up with
increased bruising and bleeding.

490
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:48,510
There may be sexual side effects.

491
00:39:48,556 --> 00:39:51,252
Your skin may become
dry and irritated...

492
00:40:20,146 --> 00:40:21,810
Got anything to say?

493
00:40:28,987 --> 00:40:31,057
What do you know
about that?

494
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:34,866
- Nothing.
- That's not going to fly this time.

495
00:40:34,895 --> 00:40:37,428
How many chances
have we given you?

496
00:40:37,995 --> 00:40:40,271
How many times
have we sat right here

497
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:42,531
and had the same conversation
over and over again

498
00:40:42,533 --> 00:40:45,331
where you look us in the eye
and you plead ignorance,

499
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:47,382
and you play
on our emotions,

500
00:40:47,414 --> 00:40:50,119
and you tell us anything
you think we want to hear

501
00:40:50,123 --> 00:40:52,978
just so we'll give you
another chance?

502
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:56,816
And it makes us feel
like fools, every time.

503
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:03,001
Enough, Jesse.

504
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,492
Enough.

505
00:41:06,735 --> 00:41:09,547
We are not going
to have this in our house.

506
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,657
We need you to leave.

507
00:41:52,807 --> 00:41:54,907
Thanks for not telling on me.

508
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,960
You think
I could have it back?

509
00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:18,472
It's skunk weed anyway.

510
00:42:43,016 --> 00:42:45,807
You know,
this is actually very hopeful.

511
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:53,829
Did you hear me?

512
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:57,385
I said this is really
very, very hopeful.

513
00:43:02,543 --> 00:43:05,895
Can I call them and tell them
you'll start next week?

514
00:43:21,137 --> 00:43:23,576
I just think that we need to...

515
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:26,316
discuss it a little more,
that's all.

516
00:43:26,324 --> 00:43:28,637
What is there to discuss?

517
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,854
You're going to get
the best treatment

518
00:43:30,953 --> 00:43:32,665
and he's the best.

519
00:43:32,725 --> 00:43:34,637
Well, there's the money discussion.

520
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:38,080
$90,000 out of pocket.

521
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:40,475
- Maybe more.
- There's a way, Walt.

522
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:44,166
There's financing,
there's installment plans.

523
00:43:44,298 --> 00:43:46,388
I could always go back to work.

524
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:48,565
Walt, there's always a way.

525
00:43:48,595 --> 00:43:49,642
All right.

526
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:52,805
Skyler, say that
there is a way.

527
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,792
And we spend
all that money, and...

528
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:11,391
Am I supposed to leave you
with all that debt?

529
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,225
I just don't want
emotions ruling us.

530
00:44:19,883 --> 00:44:22,463
Maybe treatment
isn't the way to go.

531
00:44:24,016 --> 00:44:27,297
Then why don't you just
fucking die already?

532
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:32,294
Just give up and die.

533
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,120
Come on, move your ass.

534
00:45:27,432 --> 00:45:28,872
What do I care?

535
00:45:30,114 --> 00:45:33,301
Yeah, I'm not worried.
I have the best fucking attorney.

536
00:45:33,746 --> 00:45:36,464
I would not want to be
on the other side of this one...

537
00:46:55,515 --> 00:46:56,881
What the hell?

538
00:47:03,736 --> 00:47:07,181
What are you doing?
Call somebody, call the fire people.

539
00:47:09,313 --> 00:47:12,240
I don't believe it.
You know how much I paid for that?

540
00:47:17,053 --> 00:47:18,787
Why is it doing this?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
