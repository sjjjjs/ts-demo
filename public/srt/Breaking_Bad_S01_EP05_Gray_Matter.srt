1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,279
Here's my résumé.

2
00:00:06,561 --> 00:00:09,920
I mean, technically
it says "curriculum vitae,"

3
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:12,916
which I think
is more professional, but,

4
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:15,963
you know,
same thing pretty much.

5
00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:20,671
Great. But this position truly is
a no-experience-necessary kind of thing.

6
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:24,326
Well, and it doesn't
really say it here,

7
00:00:24,537 --> 00:00:28,179
but I have a solid
background in sales.

8
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:30,900
I'm pretty much
a self-starter, so.

9
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:33,794
- That's excellent, but...
- Excellent.

10
00:00:34,403 --> 00:00:37,215
I really feel
I could be a major,

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,530
major asset
to your sales force.

12
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:45,623
I'm thinking there's
a little misunderstanding.

13
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:48,118
This isn't actually
a sales job. I mean,

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,589
I'd be happy to consider
you for a sales position,

15
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:53,434
but our agents
need to be licensed,

16
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:56,129
have at least two years
on-the-job experience,

17
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:58,356
and usually a college degree.

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,728
What you would be doing
is more like... advertising.

19
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:20,994
Hey, Jesse!

20
00:01:21,536 --> 00:01:22,731
Hey, man!

21
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,879
Yo, man! What up?

22
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:27,151
Badger?

23
00:01:27,237 --> 00:01:29,522
Where you been
keeping yourself?

24
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,719
Nice duds.

25
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:34,012
Yeah. You, too.

26
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:35,372
Thanks.

27
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:39,330
Yo, why would you want to do
this lame ass job anyway?

28
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,151
I mean, no offense.

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,310
Because I'm
on probation, yo.

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,140
Gotta prove to the man
I'm rehabilitated.

31
00:01:46,403 --> 00:01:49,693
Upstanding citizen.
All that shit.

32
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,853
It's really good
exercise, too.

33
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:55,203
Look. You can't just stand there.
You have to spin the arrow.

34
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:58,959
There's all these moves you have
to learn, like the helicopter.

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,737
See?

36
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:06,981
That one's a bitch.

37
00:02:07,092 --> 00:02:08,612
I'm not very good
at it yet.

38
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:11,851
No, you really opened my eyes
to the possibilities.

39
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:13,912
Hey, anyways...

40
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:16,890
- Thanks for the toke.
- Anytime.

41
00:02:16,963 --> 00:02:18,546
Speaking of which...

42
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:22,854
You think you could maybe
hook me up with some crystal?

43
00:02:24,046 --> 00:02:27,465
Nah, I've been out of the business
for a while actually now.

44
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,817
- Thinking about retiring.
- What? No!

45
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:33,490
That stuff you made
is unbelievable.

46
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:35,332
It was pretty awesome.

47
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,874
Retirement?

48
00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:39,388
I can't be hearing this!

49
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,755
I had this partner
who was helping me cook.

50
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:46,124
I mean, I was doing
most of the work, but...

51
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:50,143
he was an asshole, so...

52
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:54,258
Anyway, pseudo's getting
harder and harder to come by.

53
00:02:54,428 --> 00:02:56,709
I can hook you up
with some pseudo.

54
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:58,609
Major pseudo.

55
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,587
I got channels, bro.

56
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:02,951
We could partner up.

57
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:06,680
No pressure.
No pressure.

58
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:08,870
Just think about it,
all right?

59
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,473
I gotta go.

60
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:23,717
Yo, this way to savings!

61
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,185
Save your dollars bills, yo!

62

64
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:06,146
It's a stupid gift.

65
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:08,159
No, it isn't. He'll love it.

66
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:10,245
I don't know
what I was thinking.

67
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:12,966
Didn't the invitation
even say "no gifts"?

68
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,454
- Walt.
- What?

69
00:04:15,057 --> 00:04:16,546
We have to go.

70
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,220
I know.
I'm not complaing.

71
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,669
Yes, you are.

72
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:24,446
Look, we need this.

73
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:27,620
We've been through
a lot lately, okay?

74
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:33,920
Guess we didn't get
the beige memo.

75
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,700
We're okay.

76
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:40,490
Yes, I look like I'm wearing
a prom dress from 1985.

77
00:04:40,528 --> 00:04:42,199
Honey, you look fine.

78
00:04:42,474 --> 00:04:45,752
Walt, this is the only thing
I could find that fit me.

79
00:04:47,138 --> 00:04:50,920
Would you look at that?
The invitation said "no gifts."

80
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:53,259
Oh, come on.

81
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:55,773
Sir, I'll take that
for you.

82
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,226
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

83
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:05,389
Oh, look,
there's Elliott.

84
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,329
Let's go say hello.

85
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:10,113
Elliott.

86
00:05:11,516 --> 00:05:13,456
Walt!
You made it.

87
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:16,495
Happy birthday.

88
00:05:16,496 --> 00:05:19,534
- Wouldn't miss it for the world.
- Thank you. Skyler.

89
00:05:20,505 --> 00:05:21,975
Oh, that's right.

90
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:24,570
Great to see you.
You look beautiful as always.

91
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:27,971
Well, these days a little more
big than beautiful, but...

92
00:05:27,972 --> 00:05:29,933
Of course!
Congratulations.

93
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:31,434
That was such
great news.

94
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:32,479
Thank you.

95
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:34,537
Gretchen, look who's here!

96
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:40,647
It's been ages.

97
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:43,135
It's so good to see you.

98
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,786
It's... really good.

99
00:05:46,218 --> 00:05:48,143
Skyler, welcome.
Congratulations.

100
00:05:48,155 --> 00:05:50,598
Thank you.
It's really nice to be here.

101
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,080
When are you due?

102
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,707
We're looking at
about ten more weeks.

103
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:57,676
Actually, we recently
found out that it's a girl.

104
00:05:58,034 --> 00:06:00,514
- Congratulations.
- That's so wonderful.

105
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:03,215
We've been thinking
about it for ourselves.

106
00:06:03,244 --> 00:06:05,128
Yeah, thinking about it.

107
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:09,509
By the way,

108
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:12,711
securing that patent
was just amazing.

109
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:15,895
I mean, the work that
your company is doing...

110
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,680
Congratulations,
to both of you.

111
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,809
Hard work
and a lot of luck.

112
00:06:20,812 --> 00:06:23,007
- A lot of luck.
- Oh, well, no.

113
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,221
Will you excuse us?
We gotta say hi.

114
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:28,320
Make yourselves at home.
We'll catch up later.

115
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:29,844
Sure. Okay.

116
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:32,595
- So good you're here.
- Thank you.

117
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:35,933
Shall we?

118
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:55,823
Walt?

119
00:07:56,135 --> 00:07:57,981
I thought that was you.

120
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,004
Farley!

121
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,564
Long time no see.

122
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:03,010
This Walter White.

123
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:05,225
Back at Cal Tech,
he was...

124
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,018
you were just the master
of crystallography.

125
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:11,750
I remember this one time,
we were stuck on this protein problem...

126
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:13,883
for weeks!

127
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,162
You just breezed right in

128
00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:18,650
and you had
one word for us, too.

129
00:08:18,703 --> 00:08:21,472
Synchrotrons.
It was synchrotrons, yeah.

130
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,497
They generate purer and more
complete patterns than x-ray beams.

131
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:28,404
Data collection takes
a fraction of the time.

132
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:31,343
This is the White
in Gray Matter.

133
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:33,750
Tell 'em, Walt.

134
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:35,211
Okay.

135
00:08:35,836 --> 00:08:38,656
Well, back when Elliott
and I were in grad school,

136
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,331
we came up
with the name.

137
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:43,717
Schwartz: black.
Walter White.

138
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:47,302
So, together they became
Gray Matter Technologies.

139
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:49,911
- Cute, huh?
- So you run the company with Elliott?

140
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:53,111
Well, no. No, that's
Gretchen and Elliott.

141
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:56,146
I gravitated
toward education.

142
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,558
What university?

143
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,964
It's a Stratocaster!

144
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:07,139
Not just any Strat.

145
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:08,875
That's one of Clapton's.

146
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,099
No way.

147
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:11,900
"To Elliott.

148
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:15,554
"Sorry about the buckle rash.
Eric Clapton."

149
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,417
Thank you.
This is beautiful.

150
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,440
Why is he doing this?

151
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:22,776
What is he,
like eight years old?

152
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:23,936
Here, honey.

153
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:28,832
Thanks.

154
00:09:28,991 --> 00:09:30,518
Oh, this is from Walt.

155
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:32,398
- God.
- It's okay!

156
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:45,918
Yum-Good Ramen.

157
00:09:57,406 --> 00:09:59,761
This is what Walt and I...

158
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:04,664
lived on for
10 months straight

159
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:07,509
while we were working
on our thesis.

160
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,878
They sold them down at Ralsto's
in the hardware aisle,

161
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:12,909
right next to the...
the what was it?

162
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:14,847
- Sterno.
- The Sterno.

163
00:10:15,462 --> 00:10:17,478
Yeah, 10 for $1.99.

164
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,712
To this day,
I am convinced

165
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:22,908
these noodles were responsible
for our success.

166
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:25,003
This was our lifeblood.

167
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:26,923
Where'd you find these?

168
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:29,644
I thought they'd been
outlawed years ago.

169
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:32,424
I love it.

170
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:36,484
Thank you, Walt.

171
00:10:38,734 --> 00:10:40,976
For the man
who has everything.

172
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:43,200
- No, no.
- It was.

173
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:45,512
You remember the fat guy,
the fat guy.

174
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:47,204
We used to call him
"Snot Trough"

175
00:10:47,205 --> 00:10:49,286
because he had
that thing under his n...

176
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,783
- What do you call that thing?
- That was Dobkins!

177
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:54,801
That was the same guy who always
smelled like chocolate milk.

178
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:56,876
- It was!
- No, no, no, no.

179
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:59,051
It wasn't Dobkins.
It was...

180
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:03,118
Anyway, I swear to Christ
he used to iron those patches

181
00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:06,904
onto the elbows of his
Members Only jacket because

182
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:08,970
he thought it made him
look more distinguished.

183
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:11,013
- Didn't it?
- No.

184
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:15,693
- Well, here's to Snot Trough.
- To Snot Trough.

185
00:11:15,695 --> 00:11:18,246
- Wherever you may be.
- God bless him.

186
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:22,471
And you remember
the professor

187
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:25,116
who used to hate
Robert Wilhelm Bunsen?

188
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:26,364
Yes.

189
00:11:26,498 --> 00:11:29,052
All you had to do was mention
the Bunsen burner

190
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:31,057
and he was off on a rant.

191
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:34,264
"No, he didn't invent it."
You remember the waving?

192
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:36,594
"He just improved it!"
You know.

193
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:39,846
It was easy to kill
15 minutes anyway.

194
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:44,522
Oh God, I miss this, Walt.

195
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,398
Yeah. Me, too.

196
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:51,048
Listen, we ought to
get together more often.

197
00:11:51,218 --> 00:11:54,893
Skyler and I would love to have you
and Gretchen over for dinner sometime.

198
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:57,196
Sure, yeah, absolutely.

199
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,613
But what I mean is

200
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:02,390
that you and I should
work together again.

201
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,928
- Are you going to teach high school?
- No, no. Seriously.

202
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:09,711
What's stopping us?

203
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:15,482
Wait a minute.
Elliott, what are you...

204
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:18,691
Are you asking me to come
work for you at Gray Matter?

205
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,839
Yeah. Why not?
You'd fit right in.

206
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:24,034
You're brilliant,
you've got a ton of experience.

207
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,585
Well, I...

208
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:29,185
I wouldn't really know
where to begin. I mean...

209
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:32,056
God. You have no idea.

210
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:36,087
I spend my days just drawing out
atoms on the chalkboard

211
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,267
and trying to get these kids
to learn the periodic table.

212
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,868
Look, I understand.

213
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:44,730
You're a little rusty,
but you're not seeing the upside here.

214
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:48,393
We could really benefit
from a new set of eyes.

215
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:52,330
You know what it is when you been trying
to crack some problem for months on end.

216
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:53,870
You get tunnel vision.

217
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,963
One guy thinking
outside of the box...

218
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:58,347
You may be exactly
what we need.

219
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:16,381
Well, listen, Elliott...

220
00:13:17,979 --> 00:13:21,704
Your offer is very appealing.
It really is. I thank you. But...

221
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:27,486
There's something
you should know.

222
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:31,136
I have some...

223
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,560
personal issues.

224
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:36,631
Look, there's nothing
we can't work out.

225
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:40,949
Well, yeah,
but it's complicated.

226
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,263
We can help you.

227
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:47,231
We have excellent
health insurance.

228
00:13:49,987 --> 00:13:51,325
The best.

229
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:16,388
Hey, did you try those prosciutto
wrapped figs? They were, like, wow!

230
00:14:16,403 --> 00:14:20,022
They were just... I must have had
about 30 of those suckers.

231
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:22,160
And the seafood table.
Did you see that?

232
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:26,047
They had lobster tail, they had
crab legs, there was, like, shrimp...

233
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:30,833
Walt?

234
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:33,326
What the hell
did you say to Elliott?

235
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:36,253
You told him about
the cancer, didn't you?

236
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,401
Didn't you?

237
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:40,378
I can't believe it.

238
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,337
Okay, we were talking.

239
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:45,987
He asked how you were doing,
and I am sorry,

240
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:48,499
but I don't have
the best poker face these days

241
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:50,244
where that's concerned.

242
00:14:50,248 --> 00:14:53,901
He knew something was wrong
with you and he pressed me.

243
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:55,715
He pressed you.
Come on.

244
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,641
Walt!

245
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,730
When it came
right down to it,

246
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:01,156
I didn't know what else to do
but tell him the truth.

247
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:04,643
The truth? How about
you just said "he's fine," huh?

248
00:15:06,844 --> 00:15:08,830
Maybe you could've just
have said that?

249
00:15:08,863 --> 00:15:10,275
"He's fine," and done.

250
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:12,256
I don't like the way
you're talking to me.

251
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:15,480
I don't like the way you talk
about my private affairs

252
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:18,726
to people who are not
even in our lives anymore.

253
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:22,896
- What exactly did he say to you?
- He offered me a job.

254
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:24,488
- What?
- Yes.

255
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:26,978
Kind of like some
fig leaf, you know?

256
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,916
Some face-saving bullshit

257
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:33,180
that allowed me to generously
accept his charity.

258
00:15:33,217 --> 00:15:35,981
And then, when I turned
that down, he flat-out

259
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,085
offered
to pay for my treatment.

260
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,367
Which is exactly what you
expected him to do, didn't you?

261
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,256
- Didn't you?
- No.

262
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:46,138
- Please. Come on.
- I did not put him up...

263
00:15:48,965 --> 00:15:50,850
Okay, what did you say?

264
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:54,683
Walt?

265
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:57,700
What do you think I said?

266
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:00,355
Why? Walt...

267
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,477
- You ready to go?
- I'm taking the bus.

268
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:55,539
Okay...

269
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,600
Bye, honey.

270
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,599
Hey, dude, are these
bullet holes?

271
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:46,166
No, man. Those are for,
like, you know,

272
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,842
ventilation.

273
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:49,703
Cool.

274
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,659
Nice set-up, huh?

275
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,292
- Man.
- This is nothing, man.

276
00:17:57,304 --> 00:18:00,285
I used to have, like,
twice as much glassware

277
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:04,703
until my dumbass ex-partner
drove us into a ditch

278
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:06,769
and wrecked most of it.

279
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:08,650
Big ass beaker, huh?

280
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:13,080
Wait, wait. No, that's a...
Yeah, that's a boiling flask.

281
00:18:13,316 --> 00:18:15,200
This is a beaker.

282
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:18,777
Here's a Griffin beaker,
here's a volumetric beaker.

283
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,079
Here's an Erlenmeyer flask.

284
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,731
You got...

285
00:18:25,925 --> 00:18:27,734
You really know your shit.

286
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:30,582
Well, it's just
basic chemistry, yo.

287
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:34,935
So... you got
something for me?

288
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:36,828
Oh, hells, yeah!

289
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:51,563
Okay. We're in business.

290
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:55,268
- Right on, Badger.
- Dude, check this out.

291
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:59,106
Jesus, what the hell
are you bringing that for?

292
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:00,926
Hunting.

293
00:19:01,643 --> 00:19:03,664
We might see javelinas.

294
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,728
Are you going
to help me or what?

295
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,387
Badger!

296
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:48,721
Let me see the money.

297
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:53,125
Nah, I need five each.
Come on, two more.

298
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:54,086
Here.

299
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:56,849
What about him?

300
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:00,183
Are you kidding?
He looks younger than us.

301
00:21:00,282 --> 00:21:01,394
Whatever.

302
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:04,149
What about that guy?

303
00:21:04,207 --> 00:21:07,165
- Nah, he looks like a businessman.
- So what?

304
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,226
So, businessmen
are always in a hurry.

305
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:13,703
They're always, like,
going to some meeting or something.

306
00:21:13,891 --> 00:21:16,378
Seriously, he's just
going to say no.

307
00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:19,453
This guy.

308
00:21:19,466 --> 00:21:20,822
This is our guy.

309
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,146
You're up.

310
00:21:22,577 --> 00:21:24,338
Why do I have to do it?

311
00:21:24,394 --> 00:21:26,979
Give me the crutches
and I'll go do it.

312
00:21:32,366 --> 00:21:33,929
Excuse me, hey.

313
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:36,939
We forgot our IDs
and we were wondering

314
00:21:36,943 --> 00:21:40,164
if you could do us a favor
and buy us a six-pack.

315
00:21:40,955 --> 00:21:43,422
You know, what you're
asking is illegal.

316
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:46,222
No, it's not?

317
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:48,219
Yeah, it is.

318
00:21:53,255 --> 00:21:55,083
Guess you win the jackpot.

319
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,705
This is not how I wanted
to spend my night off.

320
00:21:59,748 --> 00:22:02,114
Consider this your
first and last warning.

321
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:03,165
Yes, sir.

322
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,667
You're lucky you got
a good dad here.

323
00:22:13,828 --> 00:22:15,978
If the other guys
hadn't run,

324
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,602
I could've talked
my way out of it.

325
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,959
Not cool, man.
Not cool.

326
00:22:21,355 --> 00:22:24,783
What, you never tried to buy beer
when you were my age?

327
00:22:24,992 --> 00:22:28,176
No, I'm talking about you calling me
and not your father.

328
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:30,956
How do you think
that will make him feel?

329
00:22:40,688 --> 00:22:43,156
I don't even know
what to say to you.

330
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:46,559
Just go.

331
00:22:47,926 --> 00:22:49,941
I'll deal with you later.

332
00:22:56,966 --> 00:22:58,322
Where's Walt?

333
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:01,104
I haven't seen him
since this morning.

334
00:23:01,116 --> 00:23:03,371
Your guess
is as good as mine.

335
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,900
Listen, do me a favor,
all right?

336
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:07,902
Don't tell him
about the kid.

337
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:11,280
Just a teenager trying
to score some beer, you know?

338
00:23:11,882 --> 00:23:14,840
You know.
Just growing pains.

339
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:19,918
I mean, he finds out his dad's sick,
he starts acting out, you know?

340
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,495
First the pot,
and then this.

341
00:23:23,106 --> 00:23:24,330
The pot?

342
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:30,029
- You told me he was smoking reefer.
- That's what Skyler told me.

343
00:23:30,043 --> 00:23:31,833
I mean, you may as well have.

344
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:34,547
I wasn't talking
about Walter, Jr.

345
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,249
I was talking about Walt.

346
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:41,238
Excuse me?

347
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:43,883
He admitted it.

348
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,557
He said he liked it.

349
00:23:49,043 --> 00:23:49,967
Walt?

350
00:24:00,267 --> 00:24:02,709
I didn't think
he had it in him.

351
00:24:02,804 --> 00:24:04,933
It's like he's not
himself lately.

352
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:08,030
I mean, why would anyone
in their right mind

353
00:24:08,032 --> 00:24:09,813
choose not to do treatment?

354
00:24:09,863 --> 00:24:12,545
Especially when
it's completely paid for?

355
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:14,749
Why is he doing this?

356
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:17,874
You know what
we need to do?

357
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:21,276
What we really need to do
is sit him down, all of us,

358
00:24:21,282 --> 00:24:23,680
and get everything
out on the table.

359
00:24:23,718 --> 00:24:25,763
Talk it all through.

360
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:28,231
You mean an intervention?

361
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:29,575
No, no.

362
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:32,440
Just a family meeting...

363
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:36,480
where everyone can
voice their concerns and...

364
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,307
be heard.

365
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:48,558
You are a genius, bro!

366
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,875
This cankenstein
is unreal!

367
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:53,584
When we get back,
I'm gonna burn that dollar bill suit

368
00:24:53,598 --> 00:24:56,309
'cause we're gonna
make some mad dough!

369
00:24:57,571 --> 00:24:59,202
It's not right.

370
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:01,891
What do you mean
it's not right?

371
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:05,155
It's... cloudy.

372
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:06,723
It's not supposed
to be cloudy.

373
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:09,098
That last time,
it was glass.

374
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:10,996
So what?

375
00:25:11,037 --> 00:25:14,541
Cloudy, not cloudy,
it looks good enough to me.

376
00:25:16,707 --> 00:25:18,101
"Good enough."

377
00:25:22,717 --> 00:25:24,668
Yo, what are you doing?

378
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,957
Are you out of your mind?
I totally would've smoked that!

379
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,998
It's not for you,
it's for our customers.

380
00:25:34,006 --> 00:25:36,523
They're gonna demand
a certain standard.

381
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:37,507
What?

382
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,477
What are you...
What?

383
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,704
We'll just do it again...

384
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,569
until we get it right.

385
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:09,030
Walt...

386
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:14,210
Please have a seat
and join us.

387
00:27:05,453 --> 00:27:06,830
We can do better.

388
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,144
Don't you fucking
think about it!

389
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,856
Three entire pounds
of pseudo wasted!

390
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:17,192
You know how long I had
to spin that stupid sign?

391
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:18,662
Get off me, psycho!

392
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:20,281
Helicopter, bitch!

393
00:27:40,277 --> 00:27:41,633
Open the door!

394
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,786
Come back here, you bitch!

395
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:07,805
I'm gonna mess you up!

396
00:28:20,192 --> 00:28:23,384
I really need to understand
your thought

397
00:28:23,459 --> 00:28:25,927
process because clearly I don't.

398
00:28:26,126 --> 00:28:27,633
I feel

399
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:31,042
that this decision
you've made

400
00:28:31,102 --> 00:28:33,508
is not only not
in your best interest,

401
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:37,100
it's not in the best interest
of our entire family.

402
00:28:37,517 --> 00:28:39,921
- Look, Skyler...
- Not yet. Please.

403
00:28:39,941 --> 00:28:42,634
I have the Talking Pillow.

404
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:47,753
Everybody gets to speak
their minds, remember?

405
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,111
And then, you'll get
your chance.

406
00:28:51,424 --> 00:28:55,308
Money has always been an issue for us,
I'll give you that.

407
00:28:55,624 --> 00:28:58,351
But now that Elliott is more
than willing to pitch in,

408
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:01,884
I know, I understand that it's hard
for you to accept help.

409
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,173
Maybe it's the way
you were raised.

410
00:29:04,271 --> 00:29:05,533
But, honey...

411
00:29:06,437 --> 00:29:09,885
it's okay to lean
on people now and again.

412
00:29:10,442 --> 00:29:12,906
You need this treatment,

413
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,870
and nothing can stop you
from getting it,

414
00:29:16,075 --> 00:29:17,507
except you.

415
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:27,275
Am I allowed to respond?

416
00:29:27,393 --> 00:29:28,704
In a minute.

417
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:31,768
I think we need to go
around the circle first.

418
00:29:34,581 --> 00:29:36,766
Hank, would you
like to start?

419
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:42,445
Yeah.
Okay.

420
00:29:42,964 --> 00:29:46,821
- Well, what I'll say is...
- No, take the Talking Pillow.

421
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:55,271
All right, look, buddy.

422
00:29:56,562 --> 00:30:00,085
I know I don't get to
tell you this enough, but...

423
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,448
I care...
about you...

424
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,799
a hell of a lot.

425
00:30:07,447 --> 00:30:08,947
This cancer thing...

426
00:30:10,577 --> 00:30:12,028
Let's just...
Let's face it.

427
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:14,458
You know, you were
dealt a shit hand.

428
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,607
But...

429
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:18,791
sometimes your
luck can change.

430
00:30:18,878 --> 00:30:22,225
I mean, I can't tell you how
many times I was, you know,

431
00:30:22,232 --> 00:30:26,171
I started with a shit hand
and I ended up with a full house.

432
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:27,397
Okay?

433
00:30:28,265 --> 00:30:30,531
I mean, the key is,
you gotta hang in there.

434
00:30:30,555 --> 00:30:34,063
Man, you gotta keep placing your bets.
Keep placing your bets.

435
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:39,309
Hank... what the hell
are you saying?

436
00:30:39,356 --> 00:30:42,555
Please, Marie, let him talk.
That's what we're here to do.

437
00:30:42,566 --> 00:30:43,740
Please.

438
00:30:45,204 --> 00:30:46,466
Go on, Hank.

439
00:30:47,943 --> 00:30:49,297
Right, well...

440
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:52,033
Look at it this way, okay?

441
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:55,249
It's the bottom of the 9th.
Bases are loaded.

442
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,913
You're up.

443
00:30:57,497 --> 00:30:59,847
But you got a bum arm.
Right?

444
00:31:00,181 --> 00:31:03,384
There's no frickin' way
you're gonna hit a homer.

445
00:31:03,621 --> 00:31:07,106
So you can either let
the pinch hitter take the bat,

446
00:31:07,464 --> 00:31:11,010
or you can hold on to your pride
and lose the game.

447
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:13,519
Get what I'm saying?

448
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:15,832
No.

449
00:31:19,155 --> 00:31:22,281
You got your pride, man.
I get it. Okay? I get it.

450
00:31:22,441 --> 00:31:26,265
If this Daddy Warbucks wants to chip in,
I'm with your old lady on this one.

451
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:28,693
I say take the money
and run, you know.

452
00:31:32,507 --> 00:31:34,622
Somebody want to take this thing?
Here.

453
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:36,270
Yes, Walter...

454
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:39,840
Walter Jr.,
I'm sure you have about

455
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:44,212
a million things to say, probably,
and now is your chance.

456
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,352
Go ahead.
Just let it all out.

457
00:31:51,797 --> 00:31:53,881
- This is bullshit.
- Hey, come on.

458
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:55,218
It's all right.

459
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:00,858
Talk.

460
00:32:02,013 --> 00:32:04,024
Tell your dad
how you feel.

461
00:32:07,445 --> 00:32:09,676
- I'm pissed off.
- Tell him.

462
00:32:11,035 --> 00:32:12,748
I'm pissed off,

463
00:32:13,743 --> 00:32:15,442
'cause you're being...

464
00:32:16,843 --> 00:32:17,946
You're...

465
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,025
You're a pussy.

466
00:32:24,088 --> 00:32:26,545
You're, like,
ready to give up.

467
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,006
God. What if you gave
up on me, huh?

468
00:32:41,894 --> 00:32:45,514
This here? All the stuff
I've been through,

469
00:32:46,082 --> 00:32:49,818
and you're scared
of a little chemotherapy?

470
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:06,646
Me, personally?

471
00:33:09,532 --> 00:33:12,521
I think you should do
whatever you want to do.

472
00:33:13,976 --> 00:33:14,806
What?

473
00:33:16,215 --> 00:33:18,633
You told us to be
honest about our feelings.

474
00:33:18,634 --> 00:33:21,077
Walt's the one with cancer.
It's his decision.

475
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,168
It's not up
to any of us.

476
00:33:23,317 --> 00:33:26,130
Why in the hell
would you do this?

477
00:33:28,086 --> 00:33:31,057
I wasn't planning
on agreeing with Walt.

478
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,483
But after sitting here
and listening to you all

479
00:33:33,492 --> 00:33:35,823
talk about his future
like he has no say in it.

480
00:33:35,835 --> 00:33:38,019
He's not gonna
have a future

481
00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:39,983
if he doesn't
get treatment.

482
00:33:39,995 --> 00:33:43,023
I am a medical
professional.

483
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:47,280
I x-ray people
in treatment every day.

484
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,011
I see them every day,
and you know what?

485
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:53,694
Some of them are
absolutely miserable.

486
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,388
- Marie...
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

487
00:33:56,529 --> 00:33:59,084
And some of them
don't wanna spend

488
00:33:59,096 --> 00:34:01,747
their last weeks or months

489
00:34:01,771 --> 00:34:04,140
being picked at by doctors.

490
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:06,984
But they got talked into it
by their families.

491
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:09,569
Could I get the pillow back?
I agree with Marie on that.

492
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,381
What? Maybe Walt wants
to die like a man.

493
00:34:12,388 --> 00:34:14,892
I don't want him
to die at all!

494
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:19,279
That's the whole point of this.
So either help, or leave!

495
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:22,308
Skyler, I just wanted
to do you the courtesy

496
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:24,819
of giving you
my honest opinion.

497
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:28,387
You know, Marie,
this is not debate club.

498
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:30,276
This is my husband's life.

499
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,206
- I make one simple observation...
- My husband's life we're talking about!

500
00:34:35,047 --> 00:34:37,434
- Ladies. Come on.
- How dare you...

501
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:43,713
This is so stupid.

502
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,214
All right, I've got
the Talking Pillow now.

503
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,691
Okay?

504
00:35:04,678 --> 00:35:06,663
We all, in this room,

505
00:35:08,116 --> 00:35:09,686
we love each other.

506
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:14,050
We want what's best
for each other, and I know that.

507
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:16,866
I am very thankful for that.

508
00:35:18,385 --> 00:35:19,319
But...

509
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:21,747
what I want...

510
00:35:24,445 --> 00:35:26,793
What I want,
what I need,

511
00:35:29,143 --> 00:35:30,648
is a choice.

512
00:35:32,227 --> 00:35:35,108
What does that... mean?

513
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:42,139
Sometimes, I feel like
I never actually

514
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,627
make any of my own.

515
00:35:46,281 --> 00:35:48,201
Choices, I mean.

516
00:35:54,941 --> 00:35:56,680
My entire life,

517
00:35:58,107 --> 00:36:00,027
it just seems I never...

518
00:36:03,216 --> 00:36:06,810
you know, had a real say
about any of it.

519
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,145
Now this last one,
cancer...

520
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:19,278
all I have left is how I choose
to approach this.

521
00:36:20,181 --> 00:36:22,529
Then make the
right choice, Walt.

522
00:36:24,014 --> 00:36:26,505
You're not the only
one it affects.

523
00:36:27,878 --> 00:36:29,848
What about your son?

524
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,513
Don't you wanna see your
daughter grow up? I just...

525
00:36:40,389 --> 00:36:41,803
Of course, I do.

526
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,800
Skyler, you've read
the statistics.

527
00:36:54,105 --> 00:36:55,740
These doctors...

528
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,127
talking about surviving.

529
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:01,103
One year, two years,

530
00:37:01,116 --> 00:37:03,684
like it's the only
thing that matters.

531
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:06,666
But what good is it,
to just survive

532
00:37:06,677 --> 00:37:09,906
if I am too sick to work,

533
00:37:12,058 --> 00:37:13,550
to enjoy a meal,

534
00:37:16,628 --> 00:37:18,120
to make love?

535
00:37:25,484 --> 00:37:27,495
For what time I have left,

536
00:37:30,635 --> 00:37:32,952
I want to live
in my own house.

537
00:37:33,142 --> 00:37:35,970
I want to sleep
in my own bed.

538
00:37:36,117 --> 00:37:39,752
I don't wanna choke down 30
or 40 pills every single day,

539
00:37:39,753 --> 00:37:43,061
lose my hair,
and lie around,

540
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:45,416
too tired to get up...

541
00:37:48,156 --> 00:37:51,464
and so nauseated that
I can't even move my head.

542
00:37:54,176 --> 00:37:58,016
And you
cleaning up after me?

543
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:02,568
Me, with...

544
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,566
some dead man,
some artificially alive,

545
00:38:11,238 --> 00:38:13,716
just marking time?

546
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,243
No. No.

547
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:24,494
And that's how
you would remember me.

548
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,883
That's the worst part.

549
00:38:36,212 --> 00:38:37,419
So...

550
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,038
that is my thought
process, Skyler.

551
00:38:43,812 --> 00:38:45,096
I'm sorry.

552
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:47,051
I just...

553
00:38:50,856 --> 00:38:53,062
I choose not to do it.

554
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:47,713
All right.

555
00:40:51,747 --> 00:40:53,135
All right what?

556
00:40:57,192 --> 00:40:58,957
I'll do the treatment.

557
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,214
It's gonna be okay.

558
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,940
The lady from
the billing office said

559
00:42:02,948 --> 00:42:05,563
they usually bill
the insurance company directly,

560
00:42:05,591 --> 00:42:08,307
but since our HMO
is not paying for it,

561
00:42:08,438 --> 00:42:10,906
we can pay up front
with a credit card.

562
00:42:11,256 --> 00:42:12,141
Good.

563
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,999
And then Elliott
will send a check.

564
00:42:18,345 --> 00:42:20,398
I will take care of it.

565
00:42:26,152 --> 00:42:27,527
Walter White?

566
00:42:28,477 --> 00:42:29,249
Yes.

567
00:42:32,412 --> 00:42:33,279
Okay.

568
00:42:36,274 --> 00:42:38,045
See you in a minute.

569
00:44:10,096 --> 00:44:11,094
Elliott.

570
00:44:11,747 --> 00:44:13,443
Walt, it's Gretchen.

571
00:44:15,415 --> 00:44:16,526
Oh, hey.

572
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,033
Hey, Gretchen.
How are you?

573
00:44:19,053 --> 00:44:22,649
You know, it was really great
seeing you two the other day.

574
00:44:23,709 --> 00:44:25,216
What a party.

575
00:44:26,468 --> 00:44:29,219
Elliott told me
about the cancer.

576
00:44:30,288 --> 00:44:32,492
I'm so sorry.

577
00:44:35,277 --> 00:44:38,857
Well, you know,
it is what it is, I guess.

578
00:44:39,531 --> 00:44:42,375
I don't know what
to say except

579
00:44:42,922 --> 00:44:45,145
I'm always here for you.

580
00:44:45,344 --> 00:44:48,302
Both of us are.
We wanted you to know that.

581
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:52,063
Yeah, well, thank you.

582
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:56,865
Walt, Elliott's told me

583
00:44:56,883 --> 00:44:59,185
he had offered to pay
for the treatment.

584
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,637
You have to accept.

585
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,329
That money, as far
as we're both concerned,

586
00:45:03,335 --> 00:45:05,354
that belongs to you.

587
00:45:05,448 --> 00:45:08,512
Even the name of our company,
it's half yours.

588
00:45:11,487 --> 00:45:12,354
Walt...

589
00:45:15,812 --> 00:45:17,865
Is this about
you and me?

590
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:34,088
Gretchen, I really
appreciate the offer. I do.

591
00:45:35,006 --> 00:45:36,492
But we're fine.

592
00:45:38,014 --> 00:45:41,732
As it turns out, the insurance
came through after all.

593
00:45:41,773 --> 00:45:45,013
So... I am covered.

594
00:45:47,657 --> 00:45:51,407
Well, anyway,
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

595
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:55,241
Good, that's good news.

596
00:45:57,595 --> 00:46:00,252
You know, that really
was a great party.

597
00:46:03,644 --> 00:46:05,302
Keep in touch, okay?

598
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:06,961
Sure. Sure.

599
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,298
Thank you for calling.

600
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:11,092
You wanna cook?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
