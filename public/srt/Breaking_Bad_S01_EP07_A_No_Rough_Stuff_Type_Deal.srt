1
00:00:02,473 --> 00:00:05,947
In closing, I can tell you
we take this very seriously.

2
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:08,638
APD as well as the DEA.

3
00:00:08,722 --> 00:00:11,303
Stopping the manufacture
and sale of methamphetamines

4
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:13,234
remains one of
our highest priorities.

5
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:16,228
And the theft of lab equipment
from your school is also receiving

6
00:00:16,229 --> 00:00:17,617
our highest attention.

7
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:20,535
Rest assured, no stone
will go unturned

8
00:00:20,558 --> 00:00:23,744
in our search for the person or persons
responsible for this.

9
00:00:23,749 --> 00:00:26,311
If you have any questions,
now would be the time.

10
00:00:26,477 --> 00:00:29,899
You're talking like you haven't
caught anybody yet.

11
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,545
What about the janitor
that was dealing drugs at the school?

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,361
There is no indication that
this individual was selling drugs.

13
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:40,307
He was arrested for having
a small amount of marijuana in his car,

14
00:00:40,327 --> 00:00:41,909
not in the school.

15
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:43,853
And he's
since been fired.

16
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:45,563
I heard he had a record.

17
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:48,025
I'd like to know how he got
a job here in the first place.

18
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:51,182
- Why wasn't there a background check?
- There was one.

19
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,457
We're currently reviewing
our hiring policies.

20
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:58,088
You better be doing more than that.
He was arrested in front of my daughter.

21
00:00:58,113 --> 00:01:00,337
This guy was stealing
the lab equipment, right?

22
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:02,388
That's not our thinking
at this time.

23
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:06,090
We are looking at others who had access,
not limited to the maintenance staff.

24
00:01:06,097 --> 00:01:09,576
Are you saying there was a break-in?
Do we know exactly when this happened?

25
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,847
I mean, could it have been
during school hours?

26
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,106
We haven't been able
to establish a date or time,

27
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:16,841
but there is no sign
of breaking or entering.

28
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:19,077
Whoever took it had a key?

29
00:01:19,604 --> 00:01:23,255
We're talking inside job?
Someone who's still at the school?

30
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:27,246
At this time I'm not able to discuss
the details, but what I can tell you

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,372
is that we have some very good people
working very hard on this case.

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,063
I'm sorry, Officer.
But that sounds like double-talk.

33
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:36,102
We're trying to protect our children.
You have to level with us.

34
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:39,182
Really, we are giving you
all the information we have.

35
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:42,719
You know what I'd like to see
in this school? Drug-sniffing dogs.

36
00:01:42,846 --> 00:01:45,054
Yeah, dogs,
and metal detectors,

37
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,018
and locker searches,
and strip searches.

38
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:50,449
- Our district has strict policies...
- I heard about this school in Canada.

39
00:01:50,507 --> 00:01:53,310
They arrested one of their
groundskeepers with drugs.

40
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:57,075
And the next day they found out over
half of the students were high on LSD.

41
00:01:57,085 --> 00:02:00,006
LSD? When were you gonna
tell us about the LSD?

42
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:03,508
No. Please.
No one said anything about LSD.

43
00:02:07,765 --> 00:02:09,949
What about the equipment
that was stolen?

44
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:13,295
The equipment was taken
from our chemistry department.

45
00:02:13,873 --> 00:02:17,869
And I would like someone
to give us some specifics.

46
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:19,373
Walt?

47
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:22,629
Yeah.

48
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:26,865
Mr. White is currently
on medical leave.

49
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:29,708
But as he's chair
of the science department,

50
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,981
he's made a very special
effort to be with us here.

51
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:36,976
And I'd like to take
a moment to thank him for that.

52
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:48,698
Could you please tell us more
about the equipment that was taken?

53
00:02:49,153 --> 00:02:50,869
- Please.
- Yes.

54
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:56,193
And thank you.

55
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:04,044
The inventory list for
the missing labware is as follows:

56
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,045
one 5,000 milliliter

57
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:09,510
round bottom boiling flask,

58
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,462
one Kjeldahl-style recovery flask,
800 milliliters,

59
00:03:14,323 --> 00:03:16,468
two full-face respirators,

60
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:19,128
some sep funnels,

61
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:21,681
a sill head with
a thermometer holder...

62
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,039
Ow, my knee.

63
00:03:33,578 --> 00:03:36,534
Where... did that come from?

64
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:39,706
And why was it
so damn good?

65
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,681
Because it was illegal.

66

68
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:23,774
The basement.

69
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:25,330
Unfinished, of course.

70
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,289
But just look
at all this space.

71
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:30,647
You gotta think
rec room, media room.

72
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:33,487
Just imagine all the things
you could do down here.

73
00:04:33,904 --> 00:04:37,505
Now remember, you're buying
for this fantastic neigorhood.

74
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:39,896
Big lawns
and shade tress.

75
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,314
Walking distance
to the country club.

76
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:50,620
What happened there?

77
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:55,334
Bit of a fixer, but this house
has great bones.

78
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,943
You know what? We're zeroing in.
I've got another listing,

79
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:05,135
brand-new, right around the corner.

80
00:05:05,993 --> 00:05:06,826
Hi.

81
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,041
Hi.

82
00:05:08,662 --> 00:05:10,820
It's by appointment only.

83
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:13,039
I'm here to see the owner.

84
00:05:14,394 --> 00:05:16,087
He's in the...

85
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,397
recreational vehicle.

86
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:26,733
Yo, it's appointment only!

87
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:41,486
How you feeling?

88
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:46,341
About as good
as you look.

89
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:50,077
Jeez, you look like... Lex Luthor.

90
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,363
Listen, I visited you in the hospital,
but you were asleep.

91
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:57,631
Yeah, Skinny Pete said
you wanted Tuco's address.

92
00:05:57,707 --> 00:06:00,703
Acting like you were
all out for blood.

93
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:04,590
You are alive,
so obviously you wised up.

94
00:06:04,715 --> 00:06:07,365
- No, I did go see him.
- Bullshit.

95
00:06:07,398 --> 00:06:09,155
Are you selling your house?

96
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:11,063
I got two dudes
that turned into

97
00:06:11,065 --> 00:06:13,821
raspberry slushie and
flushed down my toilet.

98
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,366
I can't even take
a proper dump in there.

99
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:19,634
The whole damn house
has got to be haunted by now.

100
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:23,288
You didn't actually
go see Tuco?

101
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:25,334
Here.

102
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:31,146
That is seventeen-five.

103
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:33,358
Your half of the 35,000.

104
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,632
Plus there's an extra 15 in there.
It's all yours.

105
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:38,193
You've earned it.

106
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,908
You got this money
from Tuco.

107
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:40,753
Yeah.

108
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:43,497
So Tuco gave you this
is what you're saying.

109
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,714
- We made a deal.
- You made a deal?

110
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,497
- That's right.
- Wait.

111
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:51,762
Why would you make
a deal with that scumbag?

112
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,338
You see what he did to me?

113
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:55,987
Because I think that
we can do business together.

114
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:58,184
We came to
an understanding.

115
00:06:58,216 --> 00:07:00,613
No way, man! Okay?
No understanding.

116
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:02,745
Take a look at
the money in your hand.

117
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:06,159
Now just imagine
making that every week.

118
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:07,893
That's right.

119
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:11,263
Two pounds a week.
35,000 a pound.

120
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:14,106
Without even talking to me,
you told...

121
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:17,278
this insane ass clown

122
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:20,938
dead-eyed killer that, uh...

123
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,523
that we would give him
two pounds a week?

124
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:25,224
We'll just scale up
our operation.

125
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,885
- We'll add a few more hours...
- Don't talk to me about hours.

126
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:31,408
What about pseudo, man?
How are we gonna get that?

127
00:07:31,673 --> 00:07:35,060
You think the meth fairy
is just gonna bring it to us?

128
00:07:35,592 --> 00:07:38,142
It takes me a week
to get this stuff.

129
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,631
I'm driving all the way
out to Las Cruces.

130
00:07:40,644 --> 00:07:43,441
200 miles each way
to meet up with my smurfs...

131
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:46,901
- Smurfs?
- Dudes who go to the drugstores

132
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:49,767
and get a couple boxes
at a time and then sell them to me.

133
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:53,140
And that's maybe only good for,
like, maybe a half-pound worth.

134
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,260
See, that's the bottleneck
in your brilliant business plan.

135
00:07:57,274 --> 00:07:58,101
All right.

136
00:07:58,104 --> 00:08:01,861
Of course you would have known that
if you would have just asked me.

137
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,424
Well, here we are again.

138
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:07,162
Here we are.

139
00:08:07,482 --> 00:08:09,291
- Skyler, you look great.
- Thank you.

140
00:08:09,307 --> 00:08:11,825
You must be, what,
six, seven months?

141
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,556
How goes it?

142
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:14,919
It's great...

143
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:18,808
other than waddling to the bathroom
every five minutes.

144
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:22,912
The baby shower's next week.
It'll be good to...

145
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:25,915
It'll be good
to have a day that's...

146
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:27,707
just about Skyler.

147
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:28,877
Very nice.

148
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:30,795
Thank you.

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,564
Well, Walt, I see you've
committed to the hair loss.

150
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:35,559
Yeah.

151
00:08:36,371 --> 00:08:38,612
- How do you feel?
- Oh, okay.

152
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:42,123
You know,
pretty decent actually.

153
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:45,376
His color is better.
You know, his energy.

154
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:48,193
And he's even more...

155
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:50,402
physical.

156
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:51,855
More physical?

157
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:54,145
Well... sexual.

158
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:59,046
Frisky, actually.

159
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:01,755
I mean, that's got
to be a good sign, right?

160
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,272
Sure, I'll take that.

161
00:09:03,286 --> 00:09:04,573
Right, Walt?

162
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:07,673
Couldn't that mean that
the chemo is working?

163
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:11,729
Realistically, it may just mean that
we've got the anti-emetics tuned right.

164
00:09:11,788 --> 00:09:15,126
Truth is, until Walt's finished
this round of chemo

165
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:18,438
and we look at a new PET scan,
we just can't say for sure.

166
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:20,801
Isn't there anything else
we could be doing?

167
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,051
I've been wondering about...

168
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:24,548
alternative medicine.

169
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,756
I mean, Eastern healing.

170
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:30,098
You know, holistic.

171
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:32,631
Well, I can't speak
to its efficacy.

172
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:35,810
But as long as it doesn't
interfere with our treatment,

173
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,661
anything that helps my patient
have a better outlook,

174
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:41,593
a better comfort,
is fine by me.

175
00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:46,076
So you're saying
it's all psychological.

176
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,636
It doesn't make
any real difference.

177
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:53,194
Having a better outlook
can make a tremendous difference.

178
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:57,061
But it's also important
that we manage our expectations.

179
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,599
What?

180
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:25,082
A junkyard?

181
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:28,380
Let me guess,
you picked this place?

182
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:31,992
What's wrong with it?
It's private.

183
00:10:33,077 --> 00:10:36,932
This is like... a non-criminal's
idea of a drug meet.

184
00:10:37,206 --> 00:10:40,855
This is like, "Oh, I saw this
in a movie. Oh, look at me."

185
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:43,999
So where do you transact
your business? Enlighten me.

186
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:46,799
I don't know.
How about Taco Cabeza?

187
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,006
Half the deals I've ever done
went down at Taco Cabeza.

188
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:51,736
Nice and public.

189
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:54,031
Open 24 hours.

190
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:57,470
Nobody ever gets shot
at Taco Cabeza.

191
00:10:58,349 --> 00:11:00,608
Hell, why not the mall?

192
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:05,013
You know, wait at the Gap.
"Hey! It's time for the meet."

193
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,954
You know, I'll put down
the flat-front khakis,

194
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:10,433
head on over,
grab an Orange Julius.

195
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:13,913
Skip the part
where psycho lunatic Tuco

196
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:17,706
comes and steals my drugs
and leaves me bleeding to death.

197
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:29,880
Look, you don't have
to be here for this.

198
00:11:30,145 --> 00:11:32,151
Okay?
I mean, seriously.

199
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:33,520
I'm okay.

200
00:11:36,432 --> 00:11:38,248
Nah, I'm no pussy.

201
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,053
I'm good.

202
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,866
Mr. Clean and his boy.

203
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,017
I'm sorry that I had
to tune you up.

204
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,020
Respect, ese.
You gotta give it to get it.

205
00:12:12,052 --> 00:12:14,659
Hey, what are we doing
way the hell out here?

206
00:12:14,702 --> 00:12:17,377
What, they close
the mall or something?

207
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,557
Heisenberg, come on,
break it out.

208
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:27,124
That's it?
That's all you got?

209
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:29,509
We had some
production problems.

210
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,836
Point five-three.

211
00:12:32,993 --> 00:12:35,012
I thought you was
a player.

212
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,366
You told me two pounds,

213
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:40,509
and now you waste my time
with these Chiclets?

214
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:53,166
17½...

215
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:56,598
minus the half
for wasting my time.

216
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:57,606
Hey, come on.

217
00:12:57,616 --> 00:13:00,766
What, you're gonna argue?
You got something to say?

218
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:07,234
You're doing business
like a couple little bitches.

219
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:09,468
I want all of it.

220
00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:14,351
70 grand.

221
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:15,938
What did you say?

222
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,064
You like this product,
and you want more.

223
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:22,159
Consider it
a capital investment.

224
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:27,566
Loco bald motherfucker.

225
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,496
52½.
25 points vig.

226
00:13:35,237 --> 00:13:36,183
Vig?

227
00:13:38,263 --> 00:13:40,332
Interest. Weekly.

228
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:43,724
Okay.

229
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:46,096
That's...

230
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:50,878
$65,625 with interest.

231
00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:54,068
- 1.875 pounds.
- No.

232
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,438
2 pounds.
Next Friday.

233
00:13:56,463 --> 00:13:58,722
And no production problems.

234
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:03,308
Can you handle 4 pounds?

235
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:09,906
Listen, old man.
Talk is talk.

236
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:12,836
But owing me money...

237
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:14,838
that's bad.

238
00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:39,694
What did you just do?

239
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:44,407
4 pounds.

240
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:47,473
4 pounds, as if 2 pounds
wasn't bad enough.

241
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,773
We're talking 200-300
boxes of sinus pills.

242
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:54,602
There ain't that many
smurfs in the world.

243
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:57,003
We're not going to need
pseudo ephedrine.

244
00:14:57,066 --> 00:15:00,002
We're going to make phenylacetone
in a tube furnace,

245
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:04,073
then we're gonna use reductive amination
to yield methamphetamine, 4 pounds.

246
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:06,486
- So no pseudo?
- No pseudo.

247
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:09,179
So you do have a plan.

248
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:11,249
Yeah, Mr. White!

249
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:13,438
Yeah, science!

250
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:15,067
Okay.

251
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:21,924
- What's this?
- That is a shopping list.

252
00:15:22,517 --> 00:15:25,987
Getting some of those items
may be challenging.

253
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:30,373
"One autotransformer,
6 liters an...

254
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:34,355
hy... hydrous
methyl... methylamine,

255
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:37,198
two 35 M&M tube furnaces..."

256
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:39,024
That's MM: millimeter.

257
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:42,291
One 70-millimeter would be fine,
but they're hard to come by, so...

258
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,816
"40 grams thorium nitrate"?

259
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:47,369
Yo, Mr. White, I can't even
pronounce half this shit.

260
00:15:47,545 --> 00:15:49,135
You know what?
Count me out.

261
00:15:49,306 --> 00:15:50,549
I'm leaving town.

262
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,660
I'm moving to, like,
Oregon or something...

263
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:54,591
Jesse, Jesse,
listen to me.

264
00:15:55,141 --> 00:15:59,138
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

265
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:01,336
What are you doing?

266
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:03,481
This is the first day
of the rest of your life,

267
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:05,504
but what kind of life will it be?

268
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:08,607
Will be be a life of fear,
of "Oh, no, no, no,

269
00:16:08,662 --> 00:16:12,448
"I can't do this," of never once
believing in yourself?

270
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:15,679
- I don't know.
- Listen.

271
00:16:16,202 --> 00:16:17,527
These things?

272
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:19,129
We need them.

273
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,155
And only you
can get them for us.

274
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:31,268
Okay, it's ready.
There you go.

275
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:36,359
Hi, baby. I'm your Aunt Marie.

276
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:40,830
Now, you already know that because
when you watch this 20 years from now,

277
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:43,604
I will look exactly
the same as I do now.

278
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:45,452
I know it is amazing.

279
00:16:45,516 --> 00:16:48,569
I have aged shockingly well,
haven't I?

280
00:16:49,494 --> 00:16:50,466
Anyway,

281
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:54,521
welcome to your
baby shower, Esmeralda!

282
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,412
Esmeralda?

283
00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:58,195
Esmeralda.

284
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:00,466
That's your name,
and you heard it here first.

285
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:03,382
Now, that is your wonderful,

286
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:05,052
handsome older brother.

287
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:07,251
Show her, older brother,
your face.

288
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,098
Okay. Not right up the nose.

289
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,296
Not...
Back to me.

290
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:15,883
There's your mommy!

291
00:17:16,397 --> 00:17:18,456
Hello, Mommy!

292
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:21,838
And look!
There you are, Esmeralda!

293
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,537
Wake up, baby!

294
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,511
Time to party!

295
00:17:26,141 --> 00:17:27,353
Easy.

296
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,922
Believe it or not,
Esmeralda,

297
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,875
right after the party,
your name was changed to Holly.

298
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:36,256
And I believe, Hank,
that that was around the time

299
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:38,635
that we took Aunt Marie
to the insane asylum.

300
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,206
Yeah, yeah.
I dropped her off at the curb.

301
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:44,643
Then I married Shania Twain
and lived happily ever after.

302
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:49,899
There's Daddy!
Speak, Daddy!

303
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:52,426
Say hello to your daughter.

304
00:17:58,571 --> 00:18:01,107
Holly, I am very proud of you,

305
00:18:01,585 --> 00:18:05,042
and I think about you all the time.

306
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:10,874
Wherever you go,

307
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:14,256
whatever you do in life,

308
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,998
always know
that you have a family

309
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:20,458
who loves you very,
very much.

310
00:18:24,141 --> 00:18:26,286
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

311
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,898
Oh, my God, it's so cute.

312
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:32,375
Oh, Carmen, it's...
Oh, look.

313
00:18:32,484 --> 00:18:35,058
Look at that.
It's adorable.

314
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,377
I love it, Carmen.
Thank you.

315
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:38,880
You're so welcome, honey.

316
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:41,339
Thank you.
Look at the little feet.

317
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:46,823
From me.

318
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:48,611
And Hank.

319
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,143
What nice wrapping paper.

320
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:53,485
Marie always finds
the best wrapping paper.

321
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:54,598
I do.

322
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:56,024
Okay.

323
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:59,395
Let's see what this is.

324
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:00,864
Exciting.

325
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,722
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

326
00:19:11,557 --> 00:19:12,781
It's a...

327
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,621
a tiara.

328
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,166
Marie, is this...

329
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:24,307
White gold and several carats'
worth of zircons.

330
00:19:24,317 --> 00:19:26,778
Oh, Marie, you spent
too much on this.

331
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:30,152
You shouldn't have.
You really, really shouldn't.

332
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:32,859
But it's so...
It's really...

333
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:35,815
It's... sparkly.

334
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:40,166
Sparkly! Like wow!
Thank you.

335
00:19:40,176 --> 00:19:41,922
Hey, listen, Walt...

336
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,115
You got anything
stronger than beer?

337
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,218
It's just gor...
Oh, it's great.

338
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,320
I love it.
Thank you.

339
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,463
Thank you, sweetie,
thank you.

340
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:53,260
Sorry, man.

341
00:19:53,335 --> 00:19:56,828
You know, after 200 presents,
it just gets kind of old.

342
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,564
- That's nice stuff.
- It is, isn't it?

343
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:08,526
I got just the thing
to go with that.

344
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:15,221
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

345
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,170
No, no, no, no.
It's okay.

346
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,321
You mind
if I have one?

347
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:22,524
You think it's a good idea?

348
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:24,984
Hank, I've already got
lung cancer.

349
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:28,936
Okay. You got me there.

350
00:20:31,652 --> 00:20:32,574
Thanks.

351
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:36,917
Cuban.

352
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:44,042
I did a little favor
for an FBI guy.

353
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:48,836
Now, I was
under the impression...

354
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:53,038
that these were illegal, hmm?

355
00:20:54,355 --> 00:20:57,367
Yeah, well,
sometimes forbidden fruit

356
00:20:57,405 --> 00:20:59,790
tastes the sweetest,
doesn't it?

357
00:21:04,508 --> 00:21:06,236
It's funny, isn't it?

358
00:21:06,471 --> 00:21:08,736
How we draw that line.

359
00:21:08,854 --> 00:21:09,863
Yeah?

360
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:12,487
What line is that?

361
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:16,723
Well, what's legal,
what's illegal,

362
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:19,788
Cuban cigars, alcohol.

363
00:21:20,784 --> 00:21:23,875
You know, if we were
drinking this in 1930,

364
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:26,227
we'd be breaking the law.

365
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,927
Another year, we'd be okay.

366
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,057
Who knows what
will be legal next year?

367
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:37,487
You mean like pot?

368
00:21:39,871 --> 00:21:40,628
Yeah.

369
00:21:41,713 --> 00:21:43,190
Like pot. Or...

370
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:45,457
whatever.

371
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:49,100
Cocaine? Heroin?

372
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,830
I'm just saying
it's arbitrary.

373
00:21:55,262 --> 00:21:57,200
Well, you ought to visit lockup.

374
00:21:57,202 --> 00:21:59,864
You hear a lot of guys
talking like that.

375
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,848
"Hey, man, why'd you bust me
with these 14 bales of ganja?

376
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:07,845
"It's all gonna be legal next year
when Willie Nelson's president."

377
00:22:08,532 --> 00:22:11,712
Shit, buddy,
it doesn't only go one way, either.

378
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:15,724
Sometimes there's stuff
that's legal that shouldn't be.

379
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:19,293
I mean, friggin' meth
used to be legal.

380
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:24,426
Used to sell it over every counter
at every pharmacy across America.

381
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:28,027
Thank God they came to their
senses on that one, huh?

382
00:22:30,622 --> 00:22:31,505
Yeah.

383
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:46,798
Nice party.

384
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,997
A tiara.

385
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:57,012
A white gold tiara
for a newborn baby.

386
00:22:58,164 --> 00:22:59,185
Yeah.

387
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:03,559
You know, I think she got that
at Gertrude Zachary's in Nob Hill.

388
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,845
I mean, that thing
must have cost, like, what,

389
00:23:05,855 --> 00:23:08,745
$500 or $600.

390
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:14,849
You know what? I think
I'm going to return it.

391
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:16,110
You sure?

392
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:18,552
She's bound to find out.

393
00:23:18,853 --> 00:23:22,840
Well, maybe I can explain to her
that we need a Diaper Genie more than

394
00:23:23,383 --> 00:23:26,058
a white gold baby tiara.

395
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,528
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli

396
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:35,414
about alternative medicine.

397
00:23:35,423 --> 00:23:37,960
Don't worry. I'm not going
to mention that anymore.

398
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:41,314
What I mean is that maybe
there is something to it.

399
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:44,070
Here. Look.

400
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:49,128
They do this Navajo sweat lodge
up by Farmington.

401
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:52,028
Healing ceremony.

402
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,154
It's supposed to be
good for your lungs.

403
00:23:54,162 --> 00:23:56,856
I'm not saying
that I believe in it, but...

404
00:23:57,465 --> 00:24:00,405
you know,
it might be an experience.

405
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,255
Really?

406
00:24:04,222 --> 00:24:05,042
You?

407
00:24:06,006 --> 00:24:07,520
In a sweat lodge?

408
00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:10,741
I was thinking about
driving up on Friday,

409
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:13,140
coming back Sunday.
I mean, if you're okay with it.

410
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:15,746
Well, of course
I'm okay with that.

411
00:24:15,991 --> 00:24:16,938
Okay.

412
00:24:26,651 --> 00:24:28,733
- Sweat lodge?
- Yeah.

413
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:31,511
I'm already sweating.
Help me out.

414
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:35,215
- Okay.
- Right.

415
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,727
70-millimeter tube furnace.
Excellent.

416
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:42,539
This is excellent.
Very good work.

417
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:44,403
- Damn straight.
- Okay. Hydrogen.

418
00:24:44,428 --> 00:24:46,188
Electrolytically
produced, yes?

419
00:24:46,225 --> 00:24:48,057
Yeah, like you asked. I mean,

420
00:24:48,192 --> 00:24:50,071
this crap wasn't easy to get.

421
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,815
It was expensive.

422
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,981
Methylamine.
Where's the methylamine?

423
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:55,874
I don't see the methylamine.

424
00:24:55,877 --> 00:24:59,203
Yeah, well, that's where
I ran into some trouble.

425
00:24:59,879 --> 00:25:01,536
What kind of trouble?

426
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,550
Well, half this crap
I could just buy, right?

427
00:25:04,873 --> 00:25:06,742
But this methylamine...

428
00:25:07,393 --> 00:25:08,581
not so easy.

429
00:25:08,585 --> 00:25:10,672
They got it locked down tight.

430
00:25:10,765 --> 00:25:14,166
But I did find some pros
who will rip it off for us.

431
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:16,720
But they want 10 grand.

432
00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:19,010
So what's the problem?
You have the money.

433
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:22,017
No, had. I already spent
almost the whole wad.

434
00:25:22,027 --> 00:25:26,019
I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left.
I told you, all this crap was expensive.

435
00:25:26,473 --> 00:25:30,464
So these thieves, did they say where
they would be stealing it from?

436
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,464
Yeah, a chemical supply
place south of town.

437
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:35,898
They got guards
and security cameras,

438
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:37,641
big ass steel doors.

439
00:25:37,648 --> 00:25:40,661
That's why these dudes
are charging so much.

440
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:42,126
What?

441
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:59,884
So why don't we
just steal it ourselves?

442
00:26:01,952 --> 00:26:02,936
Yeah?

443
00:26:03,614 --> 00:26:05,721
How are we
going to do that?

444
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,201
With this.

445
00:26:22,228 --> 00:26:24,684
So what's this
stuff called again?

446
00:26:27,691 --> 00:26:28,926
Thermite.

447
00:26:29,412 --> 00:26:31,595
And that will
cut through a lock?

448
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,605
Because this is supposed
to be one big ass lock.

449
00:26:34,735 --> 00:26:36,742
In World War II,

450
00:26:37,385 --> 00:26:41,345
the Germans had an artillery piece,
it's the biggest in the world,

451
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:43,462
called the Gustav Gun,

452
00:26:43,616 --> 00:26:46,257
and it weighed
a thousand tons.

453
00:26:46,469 --> 00:26:50,362
And the Gustav was capable
of firing a 7-ton shell

454
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:54,994
and hitting a target
accurately 23 miles away.

455
00:26:56,554 --> 00:26:59,192
I mean, you could
drop bombs on it

456
00:26:59,196 --> 00:27:02,789
every day for a month
without ever disabling it.

457
00:27:03,903 --> 00:27:06,803
But you drop
a commando,

458
00:27:07,674 --> 00:27:08,961
one man,

459
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:11,314
with just a bag of this...

460
00:27:14,027 --> 00:27:17,073
and he could melt right through
4 inches of solid steel

461
00:27:17,075 --> 00:27:19,498
and destroy that gun forever.

462
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,596
Jeez!

463
00:27:27,216 --> 00:27:28,389
So yes.

464
00:27:29,955 --> 00:27:33,873
I think it will cut through any lock
we're likely to find.

465
00:27:34,691 --> 00:27:36,160
You'd like to return this?

466
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:38,807
It's very nice, but yes.

467
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,895
Well, it is from
the store, isn't it?

468
00:27:41,992 --> 00:27:44,250
Oh, yes.
It's from this store.

469
00:27:44,804 --> 00:27:46,810
Do you happen
to have a receipt?

470
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,639
No. I don't.
It was a gift.

471
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:51,322
A gift.

472
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,536
Mr. Wilson, could you
step over here, please?

473
00:27:56,537 --> 00:28:00,430
Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to watch
this lady while I phone the police.

474
00:28:01,184 --> 00:28:02,249
Excuse me?

475
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,552
Ma'am, this item is stolen,
as I'm sure you know.

476
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:08,159
Come with me, please.

477
00:28:10,653 --> 00:28:13,681
Oh, yes. I intend
to press charges.

478
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:16,894
Please do.

479
00:28:18,248 --> 00:28:19,560
We'll be here.

480
00:28:21,052 --> 00:28:22,316
Look, I...

481
00:28:22,987 --> 00:28:26,196
I've never stolen anything
in my life, all right?

482
00:28:26,366 --> 00:28:27,764
I told you.

483
00:28:27,812 --> 00:28:31,551
That tiara was a gift.
A baby shower gift.

484
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:33,724
So who gave it to you, then?

485
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,068
- I don't think I have to tell you that.
- You don't have to tell me anything.

486
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:40,865
You can talk to the police,

487
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:43,701
and I can tell them how
my daughter-in-law remembers

488
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:47,170
showing this particular item
to a tall blonde woman who,

489
00:28:47,174 --> 00:28:50,307
when her back was turned,
walked right out the door with it.

490
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:51,461
So there.

491
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:52,929
Oh, yeah?

492
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:56,080
Then I can talk
to the Channel 3 News.

493
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,262
Yeah. I can tell them
how you people,

494
00:28:59,356 --> 00:29:02,284
without a shred,
without a modicum of evidence,

495
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,199
illegally detained
an innocent pregnant woman

496
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,461
in a dank storeroom.

497
00:29:08,512 --> 00:29:12,131
- This is my office.
- I feel I'm being held hostage.

498
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,308
Furthermore, I'm not getting
enough air back here.

499
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,379
I don't think I can breathe.

500
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:20,966
Oh, my God.

501
00:29:21,054 --> 00:29:23,442
Oh, no.
I'm going into labor.

502
00:29:23,556 --> 00:29:24,868
Yes, I...

503
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:38,481
Hi. You've reached Marie.
Do the beep thing.

504
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:41,881
Marie? It's Skyler.
I just left Zachary's.

505
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:44,595
I need to talk to you
immediately.

506
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,358
Where's the guard?
He's supposed to be coming by.

507
00:29:50,661 --> 00:29:53,697
- You think he already passed?
- I don't know.

508
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:57,385
- There he is.
- Yeah, I see him.

509
00:29:57,579 --> 00:29:59,172
Wait till he passes.

510
00:29:59,426 --> 00:30:00,902
Okay, it's clear.

511
00:30:09,303 --> 00:30:11,825
- What the hell is this?
- It's all they had.

512
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:13,465
Then you go to another store.

513
00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:16,497
- If this is all they had, wrong place.
- Just put it on.

514
00:30:16,506 --> 00:30:18,216
Of course you can...

515
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:29,552
Okay.
This is it.

516
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,193
Oh, God.

517
00:30:49,865 --> 00:30:52,149
- Dawm. Where... Duck. Duck.
- What?

518
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:58,382
He's not supposed to come back.
What's he doing?

519
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:00,133
Oh, God.

520
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:04,665
He's going to the crapper.

521
00:31:04,702 --> 00:31:05,751
Oh, God.

522
00:31:07,383 --> 00:31:10,260
- Carry your bag.
- What? What are you doing?

523
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:44,614
Okay, there is it.

524
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:48,428
Is this going to be loud?

525
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:50,800
We'll find out
in about ten seconds.

526
00:31:52,158 --> 00:31:53,319
Stand back.

527
00:31:56,705 --> 00:31:57,664
Jesus!

528
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,640
What's going on?

529
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,214
- Where are the gallon jugs?
- I don't know.

530
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:24,572
- God!
- What?

531
00:32:25,231 --> 00:32:27,755
Let's just take this.
Come on. Come on.

532
00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:39,678
What the hell are you doing
opening the door?

533
00:32:39,684 --> 00:32:42,355
How are we going to
take this thing out?

534
00:33:20,628 --> 00:33:23,137
- How is it going to be any different?
- Can I just try it?

535
00:33:23,215 --> 00:33:25,700
- Fine, fine, go ahead.
- Jesus. Okay.

536
00:33:27,313 --> 00:33:28,272
All right.

537
00:33:34,657 --> 00:33:37,636
Yeah, baby. See?
Eat it, okay?

538
00:33:37,661 --> 00:33:39,665
I'm the king.
I'm the king.

539
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:45,612
No, no, no.
That didn't sound good.

540
00:33:51,537 --> 00:33:53,706
Well, this thing's
not going anywhere.

541
00:33:53,723 --> 00:33:57,420
We're not cooking in my damn driveway.
I tell you that.

542
00:34:04,702 --> 00:34:07,174
What part of slow it down
did you not understand?

543
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:10,913
You talk too much. It's heavy, man.
You got to wait for me.

544
00:34:11,806 --> 00:34:12,758
Okay.

545
00:34:13,288 --> 00:34:15,973
That's good, that's good.
Now just bring it up.

546
00:34:17,261 --> 00:34:18,700
Easy, easy, easy.

547
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:20,089
Okay.

548
00:34:20,572 --> 00:34:24,092
Your real estate agent,
when is she supposed to come back?

549
00:34:24,443 --> 00:34:25,632
Shit.

550
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:27,942
Yo, I don't know.

551
00:34:28,253 --> 00:34:30,436
I'll make damn sure
she doesn't.

552
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,912
Good call, yo.

553
00:34:37,057 --> 00:34:38,256
All right.

554
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:11,457
Keep the temperature steady
at 425 degrees.

555
00:35:12,129 --> 00:35:14,567
We'll need to run it
two more hours

556
00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:16,903
to have enough
to make 4½ pounds.

557
00:35:17,224 --> 00:35:19,432
4½? Not 4?

558
00:35:19,527 --> 00:35:21,730
2 pounds pays Tuco back.

559
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:26,923
4½ pounds puts us
$44,000 ahead...

560
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:28,163
each.

561
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:29,827
Right on, man.

562
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:31,941
Right on.

563
00:35:31,992 --> 00:35:34,786
With the amount of methylamine
that we got last night,

564
00:35:34,862 --> 00:35:37,609
we could make
4½ pounds a week for...

565
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,721
well, for the foreseeable future.

566
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:44,917
How long is
that going to be?

567
00:35:45,372 --> 00:35:48,085
I mean in your situation.

568
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:51,107
How much
cash do you need?

569
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,149
More.

570
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:01,738
Someone's in my yard.

571
00:36:28,835 --> 00:36:32,825
Was there, by any chance, scheduled
for this afternoon an open house?

572
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:36,443
I left them a message, man.
It's not my fault.

573
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,766
I don't care how you do it. Just keep
them out of here. Do you understand?

574
00:36:39,804 --> 00:36:41,613
- Yeah.
- Go.

575
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:13,132
You know you can't
duck me forever.

576
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,111
What?

577
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:17,174
Come on. I left you,
like, 15 messages.

578
00:37:17,264 --> 00:37:19,607
When I went to your office,
you snuck out the back way.

579
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:22,887
I didn't sneak.
I was going to lunch.

580
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:25,801
Jeez, Skyler, what are you,
the paranoid police?

581
00:37:26,006 --> 00:37:29,323
Marie, I have never been
so humiliated in my life.

582
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:33,931
That tiara.

583
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:39,244
They accused me at Zachary's
of shoplifting it.

584
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,814
What were you doing
at Zachary's?

585
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,250
I was returning it.

586
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,194
You were returning it.

587
00:37:48,513 --> 00:37:50,082
Why would you return it?

588
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,426
It just wasn't...

589
00:37:52,627 --> 00:37:55,390
Marie, what is wrong with you?

590
00:37:55,395 --> 00:37:56,927
Can you please tell me that?

591
00:37:56,936 --> 00:37:59,937
Can you tell me why
you'd do such a thing?

592
00:38:03,807 --> 00:38:07,025
What does that mean?
Does that mean you don't know?

593
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:10,208
That means that

594
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:13,816
I have no idea what the hell
you're even talking about.

595
00:38:13,922 --> 00:38:16,961
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

596
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,661
The shop...
The shoplifting.

597
00:38:21,189 --> 00:38:22,325
No idea?

598
00:38:24,747 --> 00:38:27,585
You're not going
to admit this, are you?

599
00:38:29,242 --> 00:38:32,592
I can't really admit to something

600
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:36,427
when I have no knowledge
of what it is that I'm admitting.

601
00:38:55,718 --> 00:38:57,708
Don't forget to sign in.

602
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:05,449
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

603
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,403
Excuse me. I'd just like
to see the basement.

604
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,066
- Yeah, well, it's occupied.
- It's not a bathroom.

605
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:32,432
I just want to see the basement.
What's the big deal?

606
00:39:32,793 --> 00:39:35,941
Yo, you ain't seeing
the basement, bitch. You got that?

607
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,964
Is that sinking in?
Now beat it.

608
00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:40,487
All of you all.
House is not for sale.

609
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:42,411
Get the hell out!

610
00:40:27,279 --> 00:40:28,818
So how was it?

611
00:40:29,425 --> 00:40:30,699
Was it a...

612
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,135
an experience?

613
00:40:33,671 --> 00:40:34,554
Yeah.

614
00:40:35,195 --> 00:40:37,478
It was definitely
an experience.

615
00:40:44,307 --> 00:40:45,924
What's that smell?

616
00:40:47,826 --> 00:40:49,177
Yeah. It's...

617
00:40:50,087 --> 00:40:52,509
sacred Navajo herbs and...

618
00:41:07,272 --> 00:41:09,653
Hey,
is everything okay?

619
00:41:10,733 --> 00:41:13,143
No. Not really.

620
00:41:15,549 --> 00:41:17,505
Actually, not at all.

621
00:41:20,452 --> 00:41:24,049
You know that tiara
that Marie gave us?

622
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:25,071
Yeah.

623
00:41:25,663 --> 00:41:27,947
Well, she stole it.

624
00:41:28,884 --> 00:41:29,830
Yeah.

625
00:41:30,084 --> 00:41:33,680
I practically got arrested
trying to return it at the store.

626
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,660
Oh, my God.

627
00:41:35,752 --> 00:41:39,599
She refuses to admit it.
She refuses to apologize.

628
00:41:39,611 --> 00:41:41,665
I don't know
what to do.

629
00:41:46,322 --> 00:41:47,395
Oh, well.

630
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:52,075
People sometimes do things
for their families.

631
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,890
People sometimes do things
for their families?

632
00:41:58,368 --> 00:42:00,930
And, what,
that justifies stealing?

633
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,627
Yeah.

634
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,918
That must have
been some sweat lodge.

635
00:42:09,006 --> 00:42:12,687
Have you been listening
to the words coming out of your mouth?

636
00:42:15,712 --> 00:42:18,488
What would you do
if it were me?

637
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:23,147
What do you mean
if it were you?

638
00:42:23,825 --> 00:42:26,222
If it were me,
what would you do?

639
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:30,366
Would you divorce me?
Would you turn me in to the police?

640
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,882
You don't want to find out.

641
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:56,311
Do you want
something to eat?

642
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,830
No, thanks.

643
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:20,542
What is this shit?
This is blue.

644
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:26,416
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

645
00:43:26,865 --> 00:43:29,527
It may be blue,
but it's the bomb.

646
00:43:37,629 --> 00:43:39,559
Tight! Tight, tight, yeah!

647
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,549
Blue, yellow, pink.

648
00:43:42,873 --> 00:43:45,574
Whatever, man.
Just keep bringing me that.

649
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:56,185
4.6.

650
00:43:58,108 --> 00:43:59,155
Come on.

651
00:44:00,668 --> 00:44:03,583
And what did I say, man?
This guy can cook!

652
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:06,178
You're all right, man.
You're all right.

653
00:44:06,183 --> 00:44:09,007
We're going to make
a lot of money together.

654
00:44:09,845 --> 00:44:12,381
Just remember
who you're working for.

655
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,800
What did you say?

656
00:44:17,597 --> 00:44:20,840
I'm just saying they got to know
that they're working for you.

657
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,585
Like they don't
already know that?

658
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:26,462
Are you saying
that they're stupid?

659
00:44:27,822 --> 00:44:30,132
No, I'm just...
I'm just saying.

660
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:33,153
Oh, yeah. So you're not
saying that they're stupid.

661
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:36,305
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

662
00:44:36,346 --> 00:44:39,015
No. Come on, Tuco.
I'm just saying.

663
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,284
No, you're just
speaking for me!

664
00:44:41,334 --> 00:44:45,094
Like I ain't got the damn sense
to speak for myself!

665
00:44:45,944 --> 00:44:48,757
Is that it? Is that
what you're doing?

666
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:50,329
Tuco.

667
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:57,719
Hey, why don't we
all just relax, huh?

668
00:45:05,108 --> 00:45:07,417
Heisenberg says relax.

669
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,287
Orale, homes.

670
00:45:14,226 --> 00:45:15,539
I'm relaxed.

671
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:17,824
I'm relaxed.
I'm relaxed.

672
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,042
Damn, man!
Look at that! Look!

673
00:45:39,775 --> 00:45:42,046
Yeah. That's messed up.

674
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:45,782
Okay, Heisenberg!

675
00:45:46,649 --> 00:45:47,974
Next week.
