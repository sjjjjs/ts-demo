1
00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:52,284
Let's get something straight.

2
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:55,402
This, the chemistry,
is my realm.

3
00:00:55,627 --> 00:00:57,804
I am in charge of the cooking.

4
00:00:57,917 --> 00:01:00,926
Out there on the street,
you deal with that.

5
00:01:03,638 --> 00:01:06,900
As far as our customers go,
I don't wanna know anything about them.

6
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,596
I don't want to see them.
I don't want to hear from them.

7
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,546
I want no interaction
with them whatsoever.

8
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:20,043
This operation is you and me,
and I'm the silent partner.

9
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:22,470
You got any issues
with that?

10
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,132
Whatever, man.

11
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,649
No matter what happens,

12
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:36,042
no more bloodshed.

13
00:01:37,446 --> 00:01:38,862
No violence.

16
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:33,785
Walt?

17
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,063
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

18
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:39,164
Yeah. I'm okay.

19
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:43,502
You know, honey,
you really don't have to...

20
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:48,263
Look,
I like being here with you.

21
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,185
I'm only saying that,

22
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,670
I'd be okay with it, really,
if you want to go.

23
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:00,964
You know, actually,

24
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:03,966
it would make me feel a little better
knowing that you were there

25
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:07,012
when Walter Jr.
gets home from school.

26
00:03:10,536 --> 00:03:11,325
Okay.

27
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:14,966
All right.

28
00:03:15,051 --> 00:03:17,977
- You'll call me when you're finished?
- Oh, yeah.

29
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:24,420
And have you been
in touch with Elliott?

30
00:03:24,425 --> 00:03:27,959
Because I haven't
seen a check from him.

31
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:29,903
Yes, I got it.

32
00:03:30,473 --> 00:03:32,395
- Really?
- It came, yeah.

33
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,525
Yeah, it came last week,

34
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:39,215
and I put it right into
my credit union account, so...

35
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,707
Taken care of it.

36
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,452
Good.

37
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,909
So we're good. We're good.

38
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:54,130
Could you not deposit this

39
00:03:54,506 --> 00:03:56,310
until Monday?

40
00:03:58,992 --> 00:03:59,969
Thank you.

41
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:02,671
Call if the discomfort's too much.

42
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:05,045
Otherwise,
we'll see you next week.

43
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:06,296
Yeah.

44
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,760
Chemical reactions
involve change on two levels:

45
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,752
matter and energy.

46
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:37,365
When a reaction is gradual,

47
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:40,950
the change in energy is slight.

48
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:44,418
I mean, you don't even notice
the reaction is happening.

49
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:45,884
For example,

50
00:04:46,676 --> 00:04:50,196
when rust collects
on the underside of a car.

51
00:04:55,222 --> 00:04:58,918
But if a reaction
happens quickly,

52
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,548
otherwise harmless substances
can interact in a way

53
00:05:03,618 --> 00:05:07,568
that generates
enormous bursts of energy.

54
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,226
Who can give me an example

55
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,020
of rapid chemical reaction?

56
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,448
Hint, hint. Right here.

57
00:05:26,296 --> 00:05:28,125
Like an explosion?

58
00:05:29,252 --> 00:05:30,442
Yes. Good.

59
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,167
Explosions.

60
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:34,924
Explosions are the result

61
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,079
of chemical reactions

62
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,850
happening almost
instantaneously.

63
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,550
And the faster reactants,
i. e., explosives,

64
00:05:43,783 --> 00:05:47,153
and fulminative mercury
is a prime example of that,

65
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:50,462
the faster
they undergo change,

66
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:53,317
the more violent
the explosion.

67
00:05:56,426 --> 00:05:58,975
So... explosions.

68
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,260
Okay, listen. Why don't you
start reading on your own

69
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:06,731
from the top of chapter 7,
all right?

70
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:22,762
You okay?

71
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:26,166
I got it, Mr. White.

72
00:06:26,527 --> 00:06:27,926
Don't worry.

73
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:30,280
You got kids to teach.

74
00:06:50,818 --> 00:06:52,246
Thanks, Hugo.

75
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:06,345
He's starting to lose weight,

76
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,493
which is tough...

77
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:11,462
to see that.

78
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:14,172
You know, to feel
the difference when I put my

79
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:16,506
arms around him.

80
00:07:24,328 --> 00:07:27,058
- Can I talk to him?
- Of course.

81
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:29,383
Walt...

82
00:07:32,622 --> 00:07:36,495
when you don't let me in,
when you don't tell me what's going on,

83
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:40,859
I think it's like I feel like you don't
even want me around sometimes.

84
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,773
No.

85
00:07:42,748 --> 00:07:45,910
And recently these afternoons,

86
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:48,875
when you're
coming home so late

87
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:51,498
and we're
just left wondering

88
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:53,449
where you are.

89
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:56,100
Yeah, Dad.

90
00:07:57,774 --> 00:07:59,553
What's up with that?

91
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,258
Walt,
is there anything else

92
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,302
you're holding back
from your family?

93
00:08:10,187 --> 00:08:12,079
Now's the time to share.

94
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:16,193
Well...

95
00:08:21,473 --> 00:08:24,155
I like to be alone,
I mean at times,

96
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:26,829
and it's not
about you, really.

97
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:31,247
It's just that sometimes
it feels better

98
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:35,679
not to talk at all...

99
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,996
about anything,
to anyone.

100
00:08:42,057 --> 00:08:44,921
Alone time can be helpful
for some types.

101
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:50,215
Maybe knowing what you do
when you're alone

102
00:08:51,317 --> 00:08:53,911
might make it easier
for your family

103
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:57,892
to be more accepting
of whatever it is you do alone.

104
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:01,448
Well...

105
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:06,438
I like to go on walks

106
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:11,063
a couple of times a week,
maybe more, after work,

107
00:09:13,572 --> 00:09:17,104
And I really
enjoy the nature.

108
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:21,094
You know, the cacti,

109
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:25,240
the vegetation,
that kind of thing.

110
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:31,191
It's really
very therapeutic.

111
00:10:01,472 --> 00:10:03,125
Yo! You okay?

112
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:07,441
- Did you breathe that shit?
- No. I'm just dizzy.

113
00:10:08,338 --> 00:10:09,315
Come here.

114
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:12,451
- Sit down, sit down.
- I'm burning up.

115
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:13,872
Take this off.

116
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:18,806
Sit down. Get some air.

117
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,565
Oh, God.

118
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:31,162
Yeah, that's better.

119
00:10:37,172 --> 00:10:39,339
When were you
going to tell me?

120
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,569
Tell you what?

121
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:45,538
Cancer.

122
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:48,116
You got it, right?

123
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:57,040
How did you know?

124
00:10:57,102 --> 00:11:00,712
My aunt had one
of those dots on her,

125
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,329
to target the radiation.

126
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:05,342
What is it, in your lung?

127
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:09,354
I'm your partner, man.
You should have told me.

128
00:11:09,742 --> 00:11:12,197
That's not cool,
okay? Not at all.

129
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:17,132
What stage are you?

130
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:19,911
3a.

131
00:11:22,552 --> 00:11:24,750
Gone to your lymph nodes.

132
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:38,347
Your aunt.

133
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:42,027
How bad was she
when they caught it?

134
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:45,505
Bad enough.
She didn't last long.

135
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:48,344
How long?

136
00:11:48,695 --> 00:11:50,386
Seven months.

137
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:58,585
I get it now.

138
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:01,203
That's why
you're doing all this.

139
00:12:01,616 --> 00:12:04,858
You want to make some cash for
your people before you check out.

140
00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:07,115
- You got a problem with that?
- You tell me.

141
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:10,980
You're the one that looks like you
just crawled out of a microwave.

142
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,725
You going to be able
to finish the batch?

143
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,657
Yes.

144
00:12:20,854 --> 00:12:21,906
All right.

145
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:26,767
No.

146
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:30,099
You do it.

147
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:33,841
Me?

148
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:35,799
Yeah.

149
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:40,001
What happened
to your mad skills?

150
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:47,659
Go on. Here.

151
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,681
You do it.

152
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,957
You can do it.

153
00:13:00,502 --> 00:13:03,558
If you have any questions,
I'll be right out here.

154
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:12,516
The next time, put an ice pack
on your head during chemo.

155
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,794
My aunt said it helped
with the hair loss.

156
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,075
What's this? Christmas?

157
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:02,672
This the one we found way out
in the boonies, the cook site?

158
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:08,015
- Holy shit.
- What?

159
00:14:08,283 --> 00:14:10,475
Lab pulled up an imprint
of some old writing

160
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,284
that used to be on the inside.
Old Magic Marker or something.

161
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:14,781
Yeah? What's it say?

162
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:17,628
"Property of J.P. Wynne
Chemistry Lab."

163
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:20,481
That's Walt's school.

164
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,777
We were supposed
to start at 3.

165
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:43,908
I'm out there making
fat stacks, man. Chill.

166
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:47,818
Hey. Prepaid cell phone.
Use it.

167
00:15:56,794 --> 00:15:59,272
- How much is this?
- 26 big ones.

168
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:03,084
Is that all? $26,000?

169
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:05,151
No, that's 26 hundred,

170
00:16:05,377 --> 00:16:07,769
and your share is 13,

171
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:10,680
minus 25 bucks for that phone.

172
00:16:11,395 --> 00:16:14,614
- How much meth did you sell?
- Nearly an ounce.

173
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:22,327
Last time I checked,
there were 16 ounces to a pound.

174
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,649
You smoked the rest?

175
00:16:23,686 --> 00:16:26,329
I've been out there
all night slinging crystal.

176
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,452
You think it's cake moving a pound
of meth one teenth at a time?

177
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:31,614
Why are you selling it
in such small quanties?

178
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,141
Why don't you just sell
the whole pound at once?

179
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:36,274
To who? What do I
look like, Scarface?

180
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:38,470
This is unacceptable.

181
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:40,882
I am breaking the law here.

182
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:43,381
This return is too little
for the risk.

183
00:16:43,395 --> 00:16:45,788
I thought you'd be ready
for another pound today.

184
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,566
You may know a lot
about chemistry,

185
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:50,469
but you don't know jack
about slinging dope.

186
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:54,604
Well, I'll tell you, I know
a lack of motivation when I see it.

187
00:16:56,695 --> 00:16:59,826
You've got to be more
imaginative, you know?

188
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:02,607
Just think outside the box here.

189
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,828
We have to move our product
in bulk, wholesale, now.

190
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:09,894
How do we do that?

191
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:14,229
- What do you mean, to a distributor?
- Yes. Yes.

192
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:16,554
That's what we need.
We need a distributor now.

193
00:17:16,654 --> 00:17:18,551
Do you know
anyone like that?

194
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:21,954
Yeah, I mean I used to
until you killed him.

195
00:17:35,432 --> 00:17:39,347
So who took Krazy-8's place?

196
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:41,792
Some guy named Tuco.

197
00:17:42,445 --> 00:17:44,435
A bad ass, from what I hear.

198
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:48,225
Tuco, okay. So then
just go talk to Tuco.

199
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:49,816
Right. Like,

200
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:52,216
"Hello, sir. Hey, I know
you don't know me,

201
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,129
"but would you be interested in
a felony quantity of methamphetamine?"

202
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:58,398
Well, yes, but maybe with a little more
salesmanship, perhaps?

203
00:17:58,401 --> 00:18:00,609
You just don't get it, man.
This guy's O.G.

204
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,357
What does that mean?

205
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:04,456
Jesus, look,
he's upper level, man.

206
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,840
He's not going to do business
with some dude he doesn't know.

207
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:09,973
You don't understand
the way it works.

208
00:18:09,981 --> 00:18:13,085
You can't just bum rush
some high-level ice man

209
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:14,997
and start cutting deals,
okay?

210
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:17,022
It's risky.
You need an intro.

211
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:19,016
You need
someone to vouch.

212
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,227
Well, who introduced you
to Krazy-8?

213
00:18:21,237 --> 00:18:24,143
Emilio. That's only because
I knew him from, like, third grade.

214
00:18:24,164 --> 00:18:27,841
- We can't talk to Emilio, either...
- All right, all right.

215
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,346
Look, I'm telling you,
Mr. White, it's too risky.

216
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:34,790
Okay?
I mean, we're making money.

217
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:37,768
Why can't you just be satisfied
with the way it is?

218
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:38,643
Jesus!

219
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:40,881
Just grow
some fucking balls!

220
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:24,141
Wait till Monday again?

221
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,290
Yes, please. Thank you.

222
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:58,429
Mr. White.

223
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:06,300
Thank you, Hugo.

224
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,792
- Knock-knock.
- Oh, hey.

225
00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:36,696
- How are you feeling, Walt?
- Good.

226
00:20:38,618 --> 00:20:40,822
Are you up
for having a visitor?

227
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:42,417
Hey, buddy.

228
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:44,817
Hank.

229
00:20:45,032 --> 00:20:46,816
Let me know
if you need anything.

230
00:20:46,823 --> 00:20:49,479
- I will. Thank you, Carmen.
- No problem.

231
00:20:50,805 --> 00:20:51,782
Damn.

232
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,469
That chick's got
an ass like an onion.

233
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:56,209
Makes me want to cry.

234
00:20:57,136 --> 00:21:00,421
So what are you doing here?

235
00:21:00,715 --> 00:21:03,621
Well, I had some questions
I wanted to run by you,

236
00:21:03,683 --> 00:21:05,088
work-related.

237
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:08,767
- You okay? I could come back later.
- No, no, no, no. I'm fine.

238
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:10,414
Everything's fine.

239
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,675
What do you mean
work-related, though?

240
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:17,704
Do you recognize that?

241
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:22,509
No.

242
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,294
That was used to cook meth.

243
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:31,878
Found that on some Indian land
about 40 miles from here.

244
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:35,172
Old label on the inside
used to say...

245
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:38,418
J.P. Wynne Chemistry Lab.

246
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:39,620
Really?

247
00:21:39,835 --> 00:21:42,628
I don't understand
how that came from here.

248
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:46,006
I was hoping you could help me.
We found it near an abandoned car

249
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,381
belonging to one of our snitches.

250
00:21:51,122 --> 00:21:52,386
A snitch?

251
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,092
Yeah, one of our
confidential informants.

252
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:57,402
Went missing a while back.
No body yet,

253
00:21:57,411 --> 00:21:59,858
but we're pretty sure
he's, you know...

254
00:22:00,036 --> 00:22:03,972
Probably chopped up in little pieces
and fed to the buzzards.

255
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:09,799
Anyway, any respirators like that
go missing lately?

256
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,757
No. No.

257
00:22:14,182 --> 00:22:16,726
No, I mean,
not that I know of.

258
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:19,131
I'll need to take a look
at that inventory.

259
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:21,736
Sure. I got a list
hanging on the wall.

260
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:24,244
You mind if I take a look
at your storeroom?

261
00:22:24,357 --> 00:22:27,326
Not at all, no. Be my guest.

262
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:32,558
Right. So who's got keys?

263
00:22:32,957 --> 00:22:35,450
Well, the science faculty,
the staff,

264
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:38,494
Carmen, the vice principal
has the master,

265
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,882
and me.

266
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:41,980
How about students?

267
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:43,586
No, no.

268
00:22:43,706 --> 00:22:45,259
No students have keys.

269
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,957
I should hope not.

270
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:49,963
My question is do any know
where you keep them?

271
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,381
I don't think so. No.

272
00:22:52,411 --> 00:22:55,295
Besides, I keep them right here
in my pocket anyway, so...

273
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:57,899
Walt, look, I know they're
your students, but,

274
00:22:58,223 --> 00:23:00,778
do not underestimate them.
Big mistake.

275
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:02,957
Are there
any other respirators?

276
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:04,077
Uh, no.

277
00:23:04,087 --> 00:23:07,102
Because I'm counting six.
Inventory says eight.

278
00:23:10,785 --> 00:23:12,768
Glassware looking
a little sparse.

279
00:23:12,831 --> 00:23:14,328
- Is it?
- Yeah.

280
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,498
You're missing a couple of
Erlenmeyer flasks at least.

281
00:23:19,527 --> 00:23:20,704
Oh, yeah.

282
00:23:21,515 --> 00:23:24,889
A 5,000 milliliter
round bottom.

283
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:27,936
Meth heads love
to brew in this, baby.

284
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:30,975
Going to answer that?

285
00:23:31,191 --> 00:23:33,300
No, it's just...
No, I don't...

286
00:23:33,351 --> 00:23:35,727
Maybe it's Skyler.
She's in trouble or something.

287
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:39,663
Don't ignore it on my account.
Answer it! C'mon, I got stuff to do.

288
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:41,655
- Jeez.
- Okay.

289
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,301
Hello.

290
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:46,391
Yo. What's up, Mr. W?

291
00:23:47,672 --> 00:23:48,850
Speaking.

292
00:23:48,952 --> 00:23:51,448
- Bad time to talk?
- Absolutely.

293
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:53,200
All right,
so just listen.

294
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:56,399
You know that guy
we were talking about, Tuco?

295
00:23:56,531 --> 00:23:58,454
Turns out my boy
Skinny Pete

296
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:01,263
was in the same cellblock with him
over at Los Lunas.

297
00:24:01,302 --> 00:24:02,923
So we got our in.

298
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:06,090
We're hauling a pound
to the dude right now.

299
00:24:06,672 --> 00:24:07,779
Okay, then.

300
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,305
Thank you very much for calling.

301
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:15,895
My doctor is very solicitous.

302
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,520
Look, buddy, the last thing I want to do
is get you in hot water,

303
00:24:19,527 --> 00:24:22,733
but some meth monkey
had a feeding frenzy in here, okay?

304
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:25,378
You got to keep a better
watch over your turf.

305
00:24:25,442 --> 00:24:26,632
I will.

306
00:24:27,072 --> 00:24:30,567
We don't want people
to start wondering about you, right?

307
00:24:37,488 --> 00:24:38,665
Right. No.

308
00:24:39,091 --> 00:24:40,581
Right. Absolutely not.

309
00:24:44,363 --> 00:24:46,352
So you're sure you're
tight with this guy?

310
00:24:46,356 --> 00:24:48,614
Two nuts in a ball sack, yo.

311
00:25:05,598 --> 00:25:07,752
Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete!

312
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:19,502
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea, yo. Come on.

313
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,137
Atta man.
That's what's happening.

314
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:41,552
Yo, Tuco's expecting us.

315
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:54,644
No need, man.
Me and Tuco go back.

316
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,727
Tuco. What's happening,
my brother?

317
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,814
Sick crib, yo.

318
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:22,076
You been keeping it real
since you been sprung.

319
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,973
What's it been,
like a year?

320
00:26:24,175 --> 00:26:25,986
- This your boy?
- Yeah, Jesse.

321
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:28,478
The dude with the glass
I was telling you about.

322
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:31,192
Hey, man.
Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.

323
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:33,444
Break out the ice.

324
00:26:50,138 --> 00:26:51,291
Take a bump.

325
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:53,378
No worries, man.
I'm no cop.

326
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:56,877
I said hit it.

327
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:00,835
All right.

328
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:20,372
This kicks like a mule
with his balls wrapped in duct tape.

329
00:27:21,832 --> 00:27:24,300
- Where'd you get it?
- I cooked it.

330
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:27,081
Bullshit!

331
00:27:29,453 --> 00:27:30,956
Who you working for?

332
00:27:31,404 --> 00:27:34,536
No one, man. I mean,
I have a partner that I cook with,

333
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:36,089
but that's it.

334
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,154
All right.

335
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:44,716
We got a deal.

336
00:27:44,803 --> 00:27:46,922
See? I told you
Tuco would hook you up.

337
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:47,907
Cool.

338
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:50,313
I haven't said how much.

339
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,383
All right. How much?

340
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:04,108
35 large for the pound.

341
00:28:08,913 --> 00:28:11,444
Well, you're
a little light, ese.

342
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:17,591
It's all right. Don't sweat it.
It's all good.

343
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:20,162
It's good.
Walk. Get out of here.

344
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:23,625
- What about the money?
- You'll get it.

345
00:28:23,896 --> 00:28:26,201
This is a consignment operation.

346
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,893
You want me to float 35 G's?

347
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:34,138
You don't trust me?

348
00:28:34,276 --> 00:28:37,714
No, no. Hey, it's not that, man.
It's just, you know, I don't...

349
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:39,636
I don't do business that way.

350
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:42,277
Tough shit!
The deal is done!

351
00:28:44,787 --> 00:28:46,641
You said this was cool.

352
00:28:46,754 --> 00:28:48,792
Get money for meth.
Cash up front.

353
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,838
Don't front, dude.
Tuco's good for it.

354
00:28:52,218 --> 00:28:55,156
I don't need your punk ass
to vouch for me!

355
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:00,648
Come on!

356
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:03,456
Oh, come on!

357
00:29:15,597 --> 00:29:19,582
All right, you brought me
some really clean crystal.

358
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:25,063
Do you really
want your money up front?

359
00:29:48,741 --> 00:29:50,106
Up front.

360
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:22,135
Nobody moves crystal

361
00:30:22,138 --> 00:30:24,842
in the South Valley but me, bitch!

362
00:30:45,037 --> 00:30:46,602
Good morning, Hugo.

363
00:30:47,949 --> 00:30:50,755
Don't mind if
I call you Hugo... Hugo.

364
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:57,558
We've never had a crowd
on the street like that.

365
00:30:57,753 --> 00:30:59,507
Is that Uncle Hank?

366
00:31:04,882 --> 00:31:07,638
Uncle Hank's arresting
Mr. Archuleta.

367
00:31:08,363 --> 00:31:11,271
This doesn't make any sense
to me at all. I don't understand.

368
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:14,949
I got two words for you:
background check. How about that?

369
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:20,238
Yo, yo, yo. 148-3369,

370
00:31:20,326 --> 00:31:21,929
representing the ABQ.

371
00:31:21,992 --> 00:31:23,321
What up, biatch?

372
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:25,132
Leave it at the tone.

373
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:28,618
Where the hell are you?
Call me back.

374
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,080
- Hey, Walt.
- Yeah?

375
00:31:31,758 --> 00:31:33,511
Hank's about to deal.

376
00:31:33,612 --> 00:31:36,093
Okay. I'll be right there.

377
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:45,367
All right. Let's see
what the turn brings us.

378
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:48,537
You're looking good, Walt.

379
00:31:48,603 --> 00:31:50,035
Your color's better.

380
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,082
Yeah? Thanks.

381
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,119
He's actually on
the pretty strong stuff now.

382
00:31:55,451 --> 00:31:59,037
Dr. Delcavoli's trying to talk him into
taking some time off from work, but...

383
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:01,924
Well, actually, I just
talked to Carmen this morning,

384
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:04,893
and they're getting
a substitute for a few weeks.

385
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:08,420
I just didn't have a chance
to tell you. Sorry.

386
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:10,198
Your bet, tough guy.

387
00:32:10,491 --> 00:32:11,518
Check.

388
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:14,047
Yeah. Check.

389
00:32:14,374 --> 00:32:16,123
Check's in the mail.

390
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:18,416
10 million.

391
00:32:18,465 --> 00:32:20,195
Red's 25 million.
Blue's 10.

392
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:23,219
Then 25 million
because that's how I roll.

393
00:32:23,432 --> 00:32:26,459
Hey, Uncle Hank,
why were you arresting

394
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:29,093
Mr. Archuleta the other day?

395
00:32:29,254 --> 00:32:30,683
He's a pretty cool guy.

396
00:32:30,707 --> 00:32:33,880
Well, turns out
that he has a record.

397
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,313
Yeah. Couple
of possession beefs.

398
00:32:36,772 --> 00:32:40,330
We figure he was the guy that was
stealing your school's chemistry gear.

399
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,567
I mean, you know,
he had a key.

400
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:44,408
Fit the profile.

401
00:32:44,608 --> 00:32:48,022
When we searched his truck,
we found a big old fat blunt,

402
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:51,568
which goes to prove old Huge Hugo
ain't so cool after all.

403
00:32:51,655 --> 00:32:53,053
It's to you, Walt.

404
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:55,433
Yeah, I'll call.

405
00:32:56,013 --> 00:32:57,916
I can't believe
the school system

406
00:32:57,931 --> 00:32:59,945
didn't know
about this guy's record.

407
00:32:59,972 --> 00:33:01,876
I mean, that's pretty scary.

408
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:04,479
How could something like that
just slip through the cracks?

409
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:07,320
I don't know. I mean,
for what it's worth,

410
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:10,588
Hugo just doesn't strike me
as the thief.

411
00:33:10,852 --> 00:33:13,264
Yeah, well, nothing
personal, Walt, but

412
00:33:13,296 --> 00:33:17,178
you wouldn't know a criminal if he was
close enough to check you for a hernia.

413
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:21,611
Now, that said,
we got a search warrant,

414
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,862
and we tore
old Hugo's house apart.

415
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:26,515
Turns out he's
a major league pothead.

416
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,691
But he didn't
raid your chemistry set.

417
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:31,382
You hiding something?

418
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:38,701
I'm in.

419
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:41,081
And the river card.

420
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,692
Yeah, I got nothing.
I'm out.

421
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:47,045
I'm out.

422
00:33:50,627 --> 00:33:51,592
Yowsa!

423
00:33:52,451 --> 00:33:56,149
When old "holes in her purse" bails,
you know you're in deep.

424
00:33:56,607 --> 00:33:59,074
Looks like it's
you and me, buddy.

425
00:33:59,928 --> 00:34:02,176
What's going to happen
to him? Hugo.

426
00:34:02,776 --> 00:34:06,243
Well, I mean, he's going to lose
his job, like he should.

427
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:10,401
Probably spend a couple months
in County, as it's not his first rap.

428
00:34:11,937 --> 00:34:13,603
I'm waiting.

429
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:18,513
You going to man up,
or you're going to puss out?

430
00:34:18,576 --> 00:34:19,390
Hank.

431
00:34:21,063 --> 00:34:22,378
What? Sorry.

432
00:34:26,434 --> 00:34:27,687
I'm all in.

433
00:34:31,327 --> 00:34:32,091
No.

434
00:34:33,122 --> 00:34:37,055
You bad, bad, bad,
horrible liar.

435
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:40,478
What are you smoking
there, huh?

436
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:44,862
You got a heart?
You got the flush, don't you?

437
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,189
Nope. Not falling for it,
buddy. I fold.

438
00:34:54,082 --> 00:34:56,029
Talk about anti-climactic.

439
00:34:56,038 --> 00:34:58,660
Your cards couldn't
have been that bad.

440
00:34:58,734 --> 00:35:01,663
Oh, my God.
You threw away an ace...

441
00:35:01,688 --> 00:35:05,048
- What are you doing? Don't.
- ...and a cowboy, for...

442
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:12,052
A handful of nothing.

443
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,411
Who is this?

444
00:36:14,687 --> 00:36:16,641
I was dialing Jesse Pinkman.

445
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,781
Well, where is he, then?

446
00:36:36,326 --> 00:36:37,616
You the guy?

447
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,248
Yeah, I'm the guy.

448
00:36:45,864 --> 00:36:47,137
How is he?

449
00:36:48,381 --> 00:36:50,805
Got some busted ribs
and like that.

450
00:36:52,213 --> 00:36:54,380
Got messed up
pretty good.

451
00:36:54,628 --> 00:36:57,484
I was all like
"Damn, Tuco, chill, ese."

452
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:02,156
I don't know what got into him.
Seriously.

453
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:07,297
Oh, he's out, man,
way out.

454
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:10,489
They got him doped up
big-time.

455
00:37:16,255 --> 00:37:18,334
So you're the cook, huh?

456
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:22,151
Yo, I didn't
catch your name.

457
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,377
Tell me about this Tuco.

458
00:37:39,473 --> 00:37:41,700
Tell me everything about him.

459
00:39:23,735 --> 00:39:24,962
Good morning.

460
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:30,048
Would you
pass the butter, please?

461
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:34,071
Bad ass, Dad.

462
00:40:27,205 --> 00:40:28,467
You Tuco?

463
00:40:33,944 --> 00:40:37,464
I want to talk to Tuco,
and I'm not leaving until I do.

464
00:42:02,322 --> 00:42:03,820
What's your name?

465
00:42:04,617 --> 00:42:06,145
Heisenberg.

466
00:42:06,419 --> 00:42:07,910
Heisenberg.

467
00:42:08,915 --> 00:42:09,780
Okay.

468
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:12,631
Have a seat, Heisenberg.

469
00:42:13,451 --> 00:42:16,136
I don't imagine
I'll be here very long.

470
00:42:16,257 --> 00:42:17,559
No?

471
00:42:18,645 --> 00:42:19,835
All right.

472
00:42:21,828 --> 00:42:23,105
Be that way.

473
00:42:25,685 --> 00:42:27,326
It's your meeting.

474
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:30,853
Why don't you start talking
and tell me what you want?

475
00:42:31,857 --> 00:42:33,323
$50,000.

476
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:38,069
Oh, man! 50 G's?

477
00:42:38,448 --> 00:42:39,793
How you figure that?

478
00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:42,268
35 for the pound
of meth you stole

479
00:42:42,418 --> 00:42:45,625
and another 15 for my partner's
pain and suffering.

480
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,178
Partner.

481
00:42:59,442 --> 00:43:02,723
Oh, yeah. I remember
that little bitch.

482
00:43:03,704 --> 00:43:05,745
So you must be Daddy.

483
00:43:14,377 --> 00:43:16,193
Let me get this straight.

484
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,467
I steal your dope, hmm?

485
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:25,049
I beat the piss
out of your mule boy!

486
00:43:25,848 --> 00:43:29,782
And then you walk in here,
and you bring me more meth?

487
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,955
That's a brilliant plan, ese.

488
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:37,145
Brilliant.

489
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:41,148
You got one part
of that wrong.

490
00:43:45,715 --> 00:43:48,170
This is not meth.

491
00:44:15,882 --> 00:44:17,335
Are you nuts?

492
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:19,266
You want to find out?

493
00:44:19,969 --> 00:44:22,233
No-Doze, Gonzo, calma!

494
00:44:22,592 --> 00:44:24,440
Calma. Calma.

495
00:44:27,072 --> 00:44:28,701
You got balls.

496
00:44:29,035 --> 00:44:30,564
I'll give you that.

497
00:44:30,689 --> 00:44:32,239
All right. All right.

498
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:34,293
I'll give you your money.

499
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:42,224
That crystal that your
partner brought me,

500
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:45,160
it sold faster

501
00:44:45,662 --> 00:44:47,823
than $10 ass in TJ.

502
00:44:51,801 --> 00:44:53,630
What say you bring me

503
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:55,897
another pound next week?

504
00:44:59,112 --> 00:45:00,694
Money up front.

505
00:45:01,003 --> 00:45:02,042
All right.

506
00:45:03,561 --> 00:45:05,164
Money up front.

507
00:45:09,756 --> 00:45:12,825
Sometimes you got to rob
to keep your riches.

508
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:17,342
Just as long as we
got an understanding.

509
00:45:20,204 --> 00:45:22,430
One pound
is not going to cut it.

510
00:45:22,671 --> 00:45:24,478
You have to take two.

511
00:45:31,087 --> 00:45:32,240
Orale.

512
00:45:35,373 --> 00:45:36,738
What is that shit?

513
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:40,715
Fulminated mercury.

514
00:45:42,052 --> 00:45:44,357
A little tweak of chemistry.
